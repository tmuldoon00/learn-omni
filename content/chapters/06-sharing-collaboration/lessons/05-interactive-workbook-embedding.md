# Interactive Workbook Embedding

While traditional dashboard embedding provides powerful read-only analytics experiences, interactive workbook embedding takes this to the next level by enabling your customers to build their own analyses directly within your application. This creates richer, more engaging experiences that drive deeper customer engagement and value.

## Beyond Read-Only Analytics

### The Evolution of Embedded Analytics
Traditional embedded analytics provide:
- **Static Dashboards** - Pre-built visualizations that customers can view
- **Basic Filtering** - Limited interactivity through dashboard filters
- **Fixed Analysis** - Customers see only what you've predetermined

Interactive workbook embedding enables:
- **Customer-Built Analysis** - Users create their own queries and visualizations
- **Exploratory Analytics** - Free-form data exploration within your application
- **Personalized Insights** - Each customer discovers insights relevant to their specific needs
- **Self-Service Capabilities** - Reduced support burden as customers answer their own questions

### Business Impact
Interactive embedding transforms customer relationships:
- **Increased Engagement** - Customers spend more time in your application
- **Higher Retention** - Valuable analytics capabilities create switching costs
- **Reduced Support** - Customers self-serve their analytical needs
- **Competitive Differentiation** - Advanced analytics capabilities set you apart from competitors

  },
  styling: {
    primaryColor: '#your-brand-color',
    fontFamily: 'your-brand-font'
  },
  features: {
