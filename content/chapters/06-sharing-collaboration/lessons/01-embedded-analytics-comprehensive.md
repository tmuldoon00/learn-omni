## Technical Architecture: Embedded Analytics Platform

### **Comprehensive Integration Framework**
Understanding the sophisticated technology enabling customer-facing analytics:

#### **Seamless Embedding Architecture**
```typescript
// Complete embedded analytics integration
interface EmbeddedAnalyticsConfig {
  // Visual integration
  branding: {
    logo: string;
    colors: {
      primary: string;
      secondary: string;
      accent: string;
    };
    fonts: {
      primary: string;
      secondary: string;
    };
    theme: 'light' | 'dark' | 'custom';
  };
  
  // Functional integration
  capabilities: {
    dashboards: 'view_only' | 'interactive' | 'full_editing';
    workbooks: 'disabled' | 'guided' | 'unrestricted';
    exports: 'none' | 'basic' | 'advanced';
    sharing: 'internal_only' | 'customer_sharing' | 'public_sharing';
  };
  
  // Security integration
  authentication: {
    method: 'sso' | 'jwt' | 'api_key';
    user_mapping: CustomerUserMapping;
    permissions: CustomerPermissionMatrix;
  };
}

class EmbeddedAnalyticsEngine {
  constructor(private config: EmbeddedAnalyticsConfig) {}
  
  async embedDashboard(dashboardId: string, customerId: string): Promise<EmbeddedDashboard> {
    // Apply customer-specific branding
    const brandedDashboard = await this.applyCustomerBranding(
      dashboardId,
      this.config.branding,
      customerId
    );
    
    // Configure customer permissions
    const permissionContext = await this.buildPermissionContext(
      customerId,
      this.config.authentication.permissions
    );
    
    // Create customer-specific data context
    const dataContext = await this.createCustomerDataContext(
      customerId,
      permissionContext
    );
    
    return new EmbeddedDashboard({
      content: brandedDashboard,
      permissions: permissionContext,
      data: dataContext,
      capabilities: this.config.capabilities
    });
  }
}
```

#### **Customer Data Isolation**
```sql
-- Automatic customer data isolation for embedded analytics
CREATE VIEW customer_analytics_view AS
SELECT 
  -- Customer-specific data filtering
  customer_id,
  metric_name,
  metric_value,
  time_period,
  dimension_values
FROM analytics_data
WHERE customer_id = {{ embedded_user.customer_id }}
  AND data_access_level <= {{ embedded_user.permission_level }}
  AND metric_name IN ({{ customer_available_metrics }})

-- Row-level security ensures complete data isolation
CREATE POLICY customer_data_isolation ON analytics_data
FOR ALL TO embedded_analytics_role
USING (customer_id = current_setting('app.embedded_customer_id')::text)
```

### **Dual Experience Architecture**
Sophisticated approaches to serving both curated and self-service experiences:

#### **Curated Dashboard Experience**
```yaml
# Pre-built customer dashboards

      - monthly_recurring_revenue
      - customer_acquisition_cost
      - churn_rate
      - net_promoter_score
    visualizations:
      - executive_kpi_tiles
      - trend_analysis_charts
      - comparative_performance_metrics
    
  operational_performance:
    target_audience: "Operations managers and team leads"
    update_frequency: "real_time"
    key_metrics:
      - operational_efficiency
      - resource_utilization

      - team_productivity
    visualizations:
      - operational_dashboards
      - performance_tracking
      - exception_reporting
```

#### **Self-Service Analytics Engine**
```javascript
// Customer self-service analytics capabilities
class CustomerAnalyticsWorkspace {
  constructor(customerId, permissions, availableData) {
    this.customerId = customerId;
    this.permissions = permissions;
    this.availableData = availableData;
    this.analyticsEngine = new SelfServiceEngine();
  }
  
  async enableCustomerAnalysis() {
    // Provide guided analysis tools
    const guidedTools = await this.createGuidedAnalysisTools({
      availableMetrics: this.permissions.allowedMetrics,
      availableDimensions: this.permissions.allowedDimensions,
      dataTimeRange: this.permissions.dataAccessRange
    });
    
    // Enable advanced analysis for sophisticated users
    const advancedTools = await this.createAdvancedAnalysisTools({
      customQueries: this.permissions.allowCustomQueries,
      dataExports: this.permissions.allowDataExports,
      visualizationOptions: this.permissions.visualizationCapabilities
    });
    
    return {
      guided: guidedTools,
      advanced: advancedTools,
      recommendations: this.generateAnalysisRecommendations(),
      tutorials: this.createCustomerAnalyticsTutorials()
    };
  }
}
```

    AVG(session_duration_minutes) as avg_session_length
  FROM embedded_analytics_usage
  WHERE usage_date >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '90 days'
  GROUP BY customer_id, DATE_TRUNC('week', usage_date)
),

customer_success_metrics AS (
  SELECT 
    c.customer_id,
    c.customer_tier,
    -- Analytics engagement correlation with business metrics
    au.dashboard_engagement,
    au.self_service_usage,
    cs.customer_satisfaction_score,
    cs.renewal_probability,
    cs.expansion_opportunity,
    
    -- Analytics-driven customer success indicators
    CASE 
      WHEN au.dashboard_engagement > 10 THEN 'High Engagement'
      WHEN au.dashboard_engagement > 5 THEN 'Medium Engagement' 
      ELSE 'Low Engagement'
    END as analytics_engagement_level
    
  FROM customers c
  JOIN customer_analytics_usage au ON c.customer_id = au.customer_id
  JOIN customer_success_metrics cs ON c.customer_id = cs.customer_id
)

SELECT 
  analytics_engagement_level,
  AVG(customer_satisfaction_score) as avg_satisfaction,
  AVG(renewal_probability) as avg_renewal_probability,
