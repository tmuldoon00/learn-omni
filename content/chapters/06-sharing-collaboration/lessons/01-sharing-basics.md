# Sharing Fundamentals

Effective sharing and collaboration are essential for getting value from your analytics. This lesson covers the core concepts of sharing in Omni, from basic permissions to advanced collaboration workflows.

## Why Sharing Matters in Analytics

### The Analytics Adoption Challenge
Many analytics implementations fail because insights never reach the people who need them. Common problems include:

- **Information Silos** - Insights trapped with analysts
- **Access Barriers** - Complex tools only technical users can navigate  
- **Stale Data** - Static reports that become outdated quickly
- **No Context** - Data without business context or recommendations
- **Wrong Audience** - One-size-fits-all reports for diverse stakeholders

### Omni's Sharing Philosophy

‚úÖ **Right Time** - Automated delivery when decisions are made
‚úÖ **Right Format** - Appropriate level of detail for the audience
‚úÖ **Right Access** - Secure, permission-based information sharing
‚úÖ **Right Context** - Insights with business meaning and next steps
