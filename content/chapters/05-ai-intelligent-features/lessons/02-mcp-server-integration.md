## Technical Architecture: MCP Integration Framework

### **Model Context Protocol Implementation**
Understanding the sophisticated technology enabling universal AI integration:

#### **MCP Server Architecture**
```typescript
// Comprehensive MCP server implementation
interface MCPOmniServer {
  // Core protocol compliance
  protocol: {
    version: "1.0",
    capabilities: [
      "analytics_queries",
      "semantic_model_access", 
      "governed_data_access",
      "business_context_injection"
    ]
  },
  
  // Omni-specific enhancements

    audit_trail: "comprehensive"
  }
}

class OmniMCPServer implements MCPServer {
  constructor(
    private semantic_model: SemanticModel,
    private security_engine: SecurityEngine,
    private query_processor: QueryProcessor
  ) {}
  
  async handle_analytics_request(request: MCPRequest): Promise<MCPResponse> {
    // Authenticate user through MCP protocol
    const user_context = await this.authenticate_mcp_user(request.auth);
    
    // Apply Omni's semantic understanding
    const query_intent = await this.semantic_model.parse_natural_language(
      query=request.query,
      user_context=user_context,
      business_vocabulary=this.semantic_model.terminology
    );
    
    // Ensure governance compliance
    const security_validation = await this.security_engine.validate_request(
      user=user_context,
      data_request=query_intent,
      access_policies=this.semantic_model.access_controls
    );
    
    if (!security_validation.is_authorized) {
      return this.create_unauthorized_response(security_validation.reason);
    }
    
    // Execute with full Omni capabilities
    const results = await this.query_processor.execute_governed_query(
      intent=query_intent,
      user_context=user_context,
      semantic_model=this.semantic_model
    );
    
    // Return structured response with business context
    return this.format_mcp_response(results, user_context);
  }
}
```

#### **Security and Governance Preservation**
```python
# Complete security model preservation across MCP interfaces
class MCPSecurityEngine:
    def preserve_omni_security(self, mcp_request, user_credentials):
        # Map MCP user to Omni user identity
        omni_user = self.identity_mapper.map_mcp_to_omni_user(
            mcp_identity=mcp_request.user_identity,
            auth_token=user_credentials
        )
        
        # Apply identical security policies
        security_context = SecurityContext(
            user=omni_user,
            permissions=omni_user.permissions,
            access_filters=omni_user.row_level_security_filters,
            audit_requirements=omni_user.compliance_requirements
        )
        
        # Validate request against Omni's security model
        authorization_result = self.authorization_engine.validate_request(
            user=omni_user,
            requested_data=mcp_request.data_requirements,
            semantic_model=self.semantic_model,
            business_context=mcp_request.business_context
        )
        
        return AuthorizationDecision(
            authorized=authorization_result.is_authorized,
            filtered_data_access=authorization_result.permitted_data,
            audit_trail=authorization_result.audit_record,
            security_context=security_context
        )
```

### **Business Context Translation**
Sophisticated mechanisms for preserving organizational knowledge across AI interfaces:

#### **Semantic Model Integration**
```yaml
# Business context available through any MCP-enabled AI interface
mcp_business_context:
  organizational_terminology:
    revenue_metrics:
      monthly_recurring_revenue:
        definition: "Predictable monthly subscription revenue from active customers"
        ai_context: "When users ask about MRR, recurring revenue, or subscription income"
        calculation: "SUM(subscription_amount WHERE status = 'active')"
        business_rules:
          - "Always exclude churned customers from current period calculations"
          - "Include expansion revenue from existing customers"
          - "Separate one-time payments and setup fees"
    
    customer_definitions:
      enterprise_customer:
        definition: "Organizations with >1000 employees or >$100K annual contract value"
        ai_context: "Enterprise accounts, large customers, or strategic accounts"
        segmentation_logic: "employee_count > 1000 OR annual_contract_value > 100000"
        business_priorities:
          - "Enterprise customers require white-glove support"
          - "Enterprise metrics should be tracked separately from SMB"
          - "Enterprise churn has disproportionate revenue impact"
```

#### **Multi-Interface Consistency Engine**
```python
# Ensuring identical results across all AI interfaces
class ConsistencyEngine:
    def ensure_cross_interface_consistency(self, query, interface_context):
        # Normalize query regardless of source interface
        normalized_query = self.query_normalizer.normalize(
            original_query=query,
            source_interface=interface_context.interface_type,
            user_context=interface_context.user,
            business_vocabulary=self.semantic_model.terminology
        )
        
        # Apply identical semantic understanding
        semantic_interpretation = self.semantic_processor.parse(
            normalized_query=normalized_query,
            business_context=self.semantic_model.business_context,
            user_permissions=interface_context.user.permissions
        )
        
        # Execute with consistent business logic
        execution_plan = self.query_planner.create_plan(
            semantic_intent=semantic_interpretation,
            data_sources=self.semantic_model.data_sources,
            optimization_rules=self.semantic_model.performance_rules
        )
        
        # Validate results against business rules
        results = self.execute_with_validation(execution_plan)
        
        # Format for source interface while preserving accuracy
        formatted_response = self.response_formatter.format_for_interface(
            results=results,
            target_interface=interface_context.interface_type,
            user_preferences=interface_context.user.preferences,
            business_context=self.semantic_model.business_context
        )
        
        return ConsistentResponse(
            results=formatted_response,
            audit_trail=execution_plan.audit_record,
            consistency_validation=self.validate_consistency(results)
        )
