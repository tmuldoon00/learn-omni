# CSV Upload with AI Analysis

## **Overview**

Master the powerful combination of CSV data upload with immediate AI analysis in Omni. Learn how to quickly analyze external datasets, generate insights, and create visualizations without complex data pipeline setup.

## **Key Learning Objectives**

- **Rapid Data Ingestion**: Upload and analyze CSV files instantly
- **AI-Powered Analysis**: Generate insights immediately upon upload
- **Dynamic Visualization**: Create charts and dashboards from uploaded data
- **Data Quality Assessment**: Use AI to evaluate and clean data

## **CSV Upload Workflow**

### **1. Smart Data Upload**
```markdown
Upload Process:
1. Select CSV file → 2. AI Schema Detection → 3. Data Validation → 4. Instant Analysis

✅ Automatic column type detection
✅ Data quality assessment
✅ Missing value identification
✅ Outlier detection
```

### **2. AI Schema Recognition**
- **Column Classification**: AI identifies data types automatically
- **Relationship Detection**: Finds connections between columns
- **Business Logic Inference**: Suggests metrics and dimensions
- **Quality Scoring**: Rates data completeness and accuracy

### **3. Immediate Analysis Generation**
```sql
-- AI generates analysis queries automatically
-- Example: Sales data upload
SELECT 
  date_trunc('month', order_date) as month,
  sum(revenue) as total_revenue,
  count(distinct customer_id) as unique_customers,
  avg(order_value) as avg_order_value
FROM uploaded_sales_data
GROUP BY date_trunc('month', order_date)
ORDER BY month;
```

## **AI-Powered Data Insights**

### **Automatic Summary Generation**
```markdown
AI-Generated Insights:
📊 "Your data contains 10,000 sales records from Jan-Dec 2023"
📈 "Revenue shows 15% month-over-month growth trend"
🎯 "Top customer segment represents 40% of total revenue"
⚠️ "Identified 3% missing values in customer_segment column"
```

### **Pattern Recognition**
- **Trend Analysis**: AI identifies growth patterns and seasonal trends
- **Anomaly Detection**: Flags unusual data points for investigation
- **Correlation Discovery**: Finds relationships between variables
- **Segmentation Insights**: Identifies natural customer/product groupings

### **Business Context Understanding**
```sql
-- AI interprets business metrics
SELECT 
  OMNI.AI.INTERPRET(
    'What does this customer churn rate trend indicate?',
    churn_analysis_results
  ) as business_interpretation,
  
  OMNI.AI.RECOMMEND(
    'What actions should we take based on this data?',
    OBJECT_CONSTRUCT(
      'churn_rate', monthly_churn,
      'customer_segments', segment_data,
      'revenue_impact', revenue_data
    )
  ) as recommended_actions
FROM customer_churn_analysis;
```

## **Dynamic Visualization Creation**

### **AI-Suggested Charts**
```markdown
For Sales Data, AI suggests:
📊 Revenue Trend (Line Chart)
🥧 Revenue by Category (Pie Chart)
📈 Customer Growth (Bar Chart)
🗺️ Sales by Region (Map)
📅 Seasonal Patterns (Heatmap)
```

### **Intelligent Chart Selection**
- **Data Type Matching**: Charts that fit your data structure
- **Business Purpose**: Visualizations aligned with analytical goals
- **Best Practices**: Follows data visualization principles
- **Responsive Design**: Charts that work across devices

### **Interactive Dashboard Generation**
```javascript
// AI generates dashboard configuration
const aiDashboardConfig = {
  title: "Sales Performance Analysis",
  layout: "grid",
  widgets: [
    {
      type: "metric_card",
      title: "Total Revenue",
      query: "SELECT sum(revenue) FROM uploaded_data",
      visualization: "number"
    },
    {
      type: "trend_chart",
      title: "Monthly Revenue Trend",
      query: "SELECT month, sum(revenue) FROM monthly_sales",
      visualization: "line"
    },
    {
      type: "breakdown_chart",
      title: "Revenue by Category",
      query: "SELECT category, sum(revenue) FROM category_sales",
      visualization: "bar"
    }
  ]
};
```

## **Practical Use Cases**

### **Marketing Campaign Analysis**
```csv
// Example CSV: campaign_results.csv
campaign_id,campaign_name,spend,impressions,clicks,conversions,revenue
C001,Summer Sale,5000,100000,2500,125,15000
C002,Back to School,3500,75000,1800,90,12000
C003,Holiday Promo,8000,150000,4200,210,28000
```

**AI Analysis Output:**
```markdown
💡 Campaign Insights:
- Holiday Promo has highest ROI (3.5x spend)
- Summer Sale shows strong conversion rate (5%)
- Back to School needs optimization (lower CTR)

📊 Recommended Actions:
- Increase Holiday Promo budget by 25%
- A/B test Back to School creative
