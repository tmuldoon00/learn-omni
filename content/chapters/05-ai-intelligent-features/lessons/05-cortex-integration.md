## Practical Use Cases

### Customer Feedback Analysis

#### The Challenge
You have thousands of customer support tickets and survey responses that need analysis:
```sql
-- Raw customer feedback data
SELECT ticket_id, customer_feedback, product_category, created_date
FROM support_tickets 
WHERE created_date >= '2024-01-01'
```

#### Cortex-Enhanced Analysis
Add AI insights directly in your Omni model:
```sql
-- Enhanced with Cortex AI functions
SELECT 
  ticket_id,
  customer_feedback,
  product_category,
  SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX.SENTIMENT(customer_feedback) as sentiment_score,
  SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX.CLASSIFY_TEXT(customer_feedback, 
    ['bug', 'feature_request', 'billing', 'general']) as issue_type,
  SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX.SUMMARIZE(customer_feedback) as feedback_summary,
  created_date
FROM support_tickets 
WHERE created_date >= '2024-01-01'
```

#### Omni Dashboard Integration
Create powerful dashboards that combine traditional metrics with AI insights:
- **Sentiment Trends** - Track customer satisfaction over time
- **Issue Classification** - Automatic categorization of support topics
- **Impact Analysis** - Correlate sentiment with product usage and revenue
- **Actionable Summaries** - AI-generated executive summaries

### Sales Intelligence Enhancement

#### Lead Scoring with Natural Language
Analyze sales notes and communications:
```sql
-- AI-enhanced lead analysis
SELECT 
  lead_id,
  company_name,
  SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX.EXTRACT_ANSWER(
    sales_notes, 
    'What is the likelihood this lead will convert?'
  ) as conversion_likelihood,
  SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX.EXTRACT_ANSWER(
    sales_notes,
    'What are the main objections or concerns?'
  ) as lead_concerns,
  deal_size,
  stage
FROM sales_leads
```

#### Business Impact
- **Intelligent Prioritization** - Focus on highest-probability leads
- **Objection Handling** - Prepare responses to common concerns
- **Revenue Forecasting** - AI-enhanced pipeline predictions
- **Team Performance** - Analyze communication effectiveness

### Financial Document Analysis

#### Automated Report Analysis
Process earnings calls, financial documents, and market research:
```sql
-- Financial intelligence
SELECT 
  document_id,
  company_ticker,
  SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX.SUMMARIZE(earnings_transcript) as key_highlights,
  SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX.SENTIMENT(earnings_transcript) as management_sentiment,
  SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX.EXTRACT_ANSWER(
    earnings_transcript,
    'What are the revenue growth projections?'
  ) as revenue_outlook,
  quarter,
  year
FROM earnings_calls
```

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Enable Cortex in Snowflake
Ensure Cortex is available in your Snowflake account:
```sql
-- Check Cortex availability
SELECT SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX.COMPLETE('llama2-7b-chat', 'Hello, world!');
```

### 2. Integrate with Omni Models
Add Cortex functions to your semantic models:
```yaml
# In your Omni model file
- name: customer_sentiment
  sql: SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX.SENTIMENT(${customer_feedback})
  type: number
  description: "AI-generated sentiment score for customer feedback"

- name: issue_category
  sql: SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX.CLASSIFY_TEXT(${customer_feedback}, 
       ['technical', 'billing', 'feature', 'support'])
  type: string
  description: "AI-classified issue category"
```

### 3. Create AI-Enhanced Dashboards
Build dashboards that showcase AI insights:
- **Sentiment tracking over time**
- **Automatic issue categorization**
- **AI-generated summary cards**
- **Predictive analytics visualizations**

### 4. Set Up Governance
Establish policies for AI usage:
- **Cost monitoring** - Track Cortex compute costs
- **Quality assurance** - Validate AI output accuracy
- **Privacy compliance** - Ensure sensitive data protection
- **User training** - Educate teams on AI capabilities

## Best Practices

### Performance Optimization

  SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX.TRANSLATE(feedback_text, original_language, 'en') as english_text,
  SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX.SENTIMENT(
    SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX.TRANSLATE(feedback_text, original_language, 'en')
  ) as sentiment_score
FROM global_customer_feedback
```

### Competitive Intelligence
Analyze market research and competitor data:
```sql
-- AI-powered competitive analysis
SELECT 
  competitor_name,
  SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX.SUMMARIZE(market_research_text) as competitive_summary,
  SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX.EXTRACT_ANSWER(
    market_research_text,
    'What are this competitor\'s main strengths and weaknesses?'
  ) as swot_analysis,
  report_date
FROM competitive_intelligence
```

### Custom AI Workflows
Build sophisticated AI pipelines:
```sql
-- Multi-step AI processing
WITH ai_enriched AS (
  SELECT 
    *,
    SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX.SENTIMENT(customer_review) as sentiment,
    SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX.CLASSIFY_TEXT(customer_review, 
      ['product_quality', 'shipping', 'customer_service', 'pricing']) as category
  FROM product_reviews
)
SELECT 
  category,
  AVG(sentiment) as avg_sentiment,
  COUNT(*) as review_count,
  SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX.SUMMARIZE(
    LISTAGG(customer_review, ' ') WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY sentiment DESC)
  ) as top_positive_themes
FROM ai_enriched
GROUP BY category
```

The integration of Snowflake Cortex with Omni opens up entirely new possibilities for AI-driven business intelligence, making advanced AI capabilities accessible through familiar SQL and dashboard interfaces while maintaining the governance and security your organization requires.
