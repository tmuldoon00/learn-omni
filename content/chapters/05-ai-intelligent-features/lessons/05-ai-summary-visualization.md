## **Snowflake Cortex Overview**

### **1. Core AI Functions**
```sql
-- Sentiment analysis
SELECT 
  review_text,
  SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX.SENTIMENT(review_text) as sentiment_score,
  CASE 
    WHEN SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX.SENTIMENT(review_text) > 0.1 THEN 'Positive'
    WHEN SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX.SENTIMENT(review_text) < -0.1 THEN 'Negative'
    ELSE 'Neutral'
  END as sentiment_category
FROM customer_reviews;
```

### **2. Text Processing Capabilities**
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Score emotional tone of text (-1 to 1)
- **Text Summarization**: Extract key points from long text
- **Translation**: Multi-language text translation
- **Classification**: Categorize text into predefined groups

### **3. Integration Architecture**

Data Source → Snowflake Cortex → Omni Analytics → Business Insights
    ↓              ↓                ↓              ↓
Raw Text → AI Processing → Structured Data → Actionable Insights
```

## **Practical Applications**

### **Customer Feedback Analysis**
```sql
-- Analyze support ticket sentiment
SELECT 
  date_trunc('month', ticket_date) as month,
  avg(SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX.SENTIMENT(ticket_description)) as avg_sentiment,
  count(*) as ticket_count,
  sum(case when SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX.SENTIMENT(ticket_description) < -0.3 
      then 1 else 0 end) as negative_tickets
FROM support_tickets
GROUP BY date_trunc('month', ticket_date)
ORDER BY month;
```

### **Product Review Insights**
- **Sentiment Trends**: Track sentiment changes over time
- **Feature Feedback**: Identify specific feature mentions and sentiment
- **Competitive Analysis**: Compare sentiment across product lines
- **Quality Monitoring**: Monitor customer satisfaction metrics

### **Social Media Analytics**
```sql
-- Social media sentiment by campaign
SELECT 
  campaign_id,
  platform,
  count(*) as mentions,
  avg(SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX.SENTIMENT(post_content)) as avg_sentiment,
  sum(engagement_score) as total_engagement
FROM social_mentions
WHERE post_date >= current_date - interval '30 days'
GROUP BY campaign_id, platform;
```

## **Advanced Cortex Features**

### **1. Text Summarization**
```sql
-- Summarize customer feedback themes
SELECT 
  product_category,
  SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX.SUMMARIZE(
    listagg(review_text, ' | ') within group (order by review_date)
  ) as feedback_summary
FROM product_reviews
WHERE review_date >= current_date - interval '90 days'
GROUP BY product_category;
```

### **2. Multi-Language Support**
```sql
-- Analyze global customer feedback
SELECT 
  region,
  language,
  avg(SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX.SENTIMENT(
    SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX.TRANSLATE(feedback_text, language, 'en')
  )) as sentiment_score
FROM global_feedback
GROUP BY region, language;
```

### **3. Classification and Categorization**
- **Issue Classification**: Categorize support tickets automatically
- **Content Tagging**: Tag content based on themes
- **Priority Scoring**: Score urgency based on text content
- **Topic Modeling**: Identify common themes in text data

## **Business Use Cases**

### **Customer Experience Analytics**
```sql
-- Customer journey sentiment analysis
WITH sentiment_journey AS (
  SELECT 
    customer_id,
    touchpoint_type,
    interaction_date,
    SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX.SENTIMENT(interaction_notes) as sentiment,
    row_number() over (partition by customer_id order by interaction_date) as journey_step
  FROM customer_interactions
)
SELECT 
  journey_step,
  avg(sentiment) as avg_sentiment,
  count(*) as interaction_count
FROM sentiment_journey
GROUP BY journey_step
ORDER BY journey_step;
```

### **Market Research Applications**

- **Performance Management**: Track team performance through customer feedback

## **Implementation Best Practices**

### **1. Data Preparation**
```sql
-- Clean and prepare text data
SELECT 
  review_id,
  -- Clean text for better AI processing
  regexp_replace(
    regexp_replace(review_text, '[^a-zA-Z0-9\\s]', ' '),
    '\\s+', ' '
  ) as cleaned_text,
  SNOWFLAKE.CORTEX.SENTIMENT(cleaned_text) as sentiment
FROM raw_reviews
WHERE length(review_text) > 10;
```
