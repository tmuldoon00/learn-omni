# AI-Powered Queries and Integration

Omni's AI capabilities extend far beyond basic query generation. With the new MCP (Model Context Protocol) server, you can integrate Omni's semantic intelligence directly into your favorite AI interfaces, making data insights accessible wherever you work.

## The Power of Semantic AI

Unlike traditional text-to-SQL approaches that are prone to errors and data leakage, Omni's AI is backed by your semantic model. This means:

- **Accurate Results** - Queries inherit business logic you've already defined
- **Security First** - Users only see data they're authorized to access  
- **Business Context** - AI responses stay grounded in your established metrics and definitions
- **Prevents Hallucinations** - The semantic model prevents AI from making incorrect assumptions

## MCP Server Integration

The MCP server transforms how your organization accesses data insights:

### Marketing Use Case
- Ask natural language questions about campaign performance
- Get instant ROI analysis across channels
- Analyze customer acquisition trends with context

### Sales Enablement  
- Query deal pipeline status conversationally
- Understand win/loss patterns through AI dialogue
- Access territory performance insights instantly

### Revenue Operations
- Monitor key metrics through natural conversation
- Get automated insights on revenue trends
- Ask complex questions about business performance

## Natural Language Query Examples

**Campaign Performance:**
> "How did our Google Ads perform compared to Facebook last quarter?"

**Customer Analytics:**
> "Show me customer retention by acquisition channel for new users this year"

**Revenue Analysis:**
> "What's our MRR growth trend over the past 6 months by customer segment?"

## Implementation Benefits

- **Zero Training Required** - Teams use familiar AI interfaces
- **Instant Access** - No need to switch between tools
- **Governed Results** - All responses follow your data governance rules
- **Scalable Insights** - Every team member becomes data-literate

## Getting Started

1. **Set up MCP Server** - Data teams configure the connection once
2. **Define Semantic Model** - Ensure business logic is captured in your model
3. **Enable AI Access** - Teams can immediately start asking questions
4. **Monitor Usage** - Track which insights are most valuable

The MCP server represents the future of data access - where asking questions about data is as natural as having a conversation, but with the precision and security of enterprise-grade analytics.
