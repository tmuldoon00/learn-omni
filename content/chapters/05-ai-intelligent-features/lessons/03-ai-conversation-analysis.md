# AI Conversation Analysis and Query Refinement

## **Overview**

Master Omni's advanced conversational AI capabilities that enable iterative data exploration through natural language conversations. Learn how to refine queries, validate insights, and explore data relationships through intelligent dialogue.

## **Key Learning Objectives**

- **Conversational Query Building**: Build complex queries through natural conversation
- **Analysis Refinement**: Iteratively improve insights through AI dialogue
- **Context Retention**: Understand how AI maintains conversation context
- **Query Validation**: Use AI to validate and improve analytical approaches

## **Conversational AI Features**

### **1. Iterative Query Building**
```markdown
User: "Show me sales by region"
AI: "Here's sales by region. Would you like to see this by month as well?"
User: "Yes, and filter for this year only"
AI: "Perfect! Here's sales by region and month for 2024..."
```

### **2. Analysis Validation**
- **Insight Confirmation**: AI explains what the data shows
- **Methodology Review**: Validates analytical approaches
- **Assumption Checking**: Questions underlying assumptions
- **Alternative Perspectives**: Suggests different analytical angles

### **3. Context-Aware Conversations**
- **Session Memory**: Remembers previous queries and insights
- **Reference Resolution**: Understands "this metric" and "that analysis"
- **Progressive Complexity**: Builds on previous analysis steps
- **Cross-Reference Capabilities**: Connects related data points

## **Advanced Conversation Patterns**

### **Exploratory Analysis**
```markdown
User: "What's driving the decline in customer retention?"
AI: "I see retention dropped 3% this quarter. Let me analyze the key factors:
     - New customer cohorts have 15% lower retention
     - Churn increased in the Enterprise segment
     - Would you like to drill into specific customer segments?"
```

### **Hypothesis Testing**
```markdown
User: "I think our pricing changes affected churn"
AI: "Let's test that hypothesis. Comparing pre/post pricing change:
     - Churn rate increased from 5.2% to 6.8%
     - Most impact in price-sensitive segments
     - Should we look at customer feedback data too?"
```

### **Comparative Analysis**
```markdown
User: "How does this compare to industry benchmarks?"
AI: "Based on your KPI targets:
     - Your retention (85%) vs industry average (82%)
     - Your NPS (45) vs benchmark (38)
     - Want to see peer comparison by company size?"
```

## **Best Practices for AI Conversations**

### **1. Clear Intent Communication**
- **Specific Questions**: Ask focused, actionable questions
- **Context Setting**: Provide business context when needed
- **Goal Clarification**: Explain what decisions you're trying to make

### **2. Iterative Refinement**
- **Follow-up Questions**: Build on AI suggestions
- **Correction Feedback**: Clarify when AI misunderstands
- **Alternative Approaches**: Ask "What other ways could we analyze this?"

### **3. Validation and Verification**
- **Methodology Review**: Ask AI to explain its analytical approach
- **Assumption Checking**: Verify underlying assumptions
- **Results Interpretation**: Confirm you understand the insights

## **Business Applications**
