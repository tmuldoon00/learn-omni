## Topic-Based Organization Strategy

### **Domain-Driven Design Principles**
Organizing models around business domains rather than technical structures:

#### **Sales Analytics Topic**
```yaml
# sales_analytics.topic
topic: sales_analytics
description: "Sales performance metrics and customer acquisition analysis"

views:
  - name: opportunities
    description: "Sales opportunities and pipeline analysis"
    
  - name: accounts  
    description: "Customer account information and segmentation"
    
  - name: sales_reps
    description: "Sales representative performance tracking"

measures:
  - name: total_revenue
    description: "Sum of all closed-won opportunities"
    sql: SUM(${opportunities.amount})
    
  - name: win_rate
    description: "Percentage of opportunities that close successfully"
    sql: COUNT(CASE WHEN ${opportunities.stage} = 'Closed Won' THEN 1 END) / COUNT(*)
    
  - name: average_deal_size
    description: "Mean value of closed opportunities"
    sql: AVG(CASE WHEN ${opportunities.stage} = 'Closed Won' THEN ${opportunities.amount} END)

dimensions:
  - name: sales_rep
    description: "Sales representative responsible for opportunity"
    sql: ${opportunities.owner_name}
    
  - name: account_tier
    description: "Customer account size classification"
    sql: CASE 
           WHEN ${accounts.employee_count} > 1000 THEN 'Enterprise'
           WHEN ${accounts.employee_count} > 100 THEN 'Mid-Market'
           ELSE 'SMB'
         END
```

#### **Marketing Analytics Topic**
```yaml
# marketing_analytics.topic
topic: marketing_analytics
description: "Marketing campaign performance and lead generation analysis"

views:
  - name: campaigns
    description: "Marketing campaign data and performance metrics"
    
  - name: leads
    description: "Lead generation and qualification tracking"
    
  - name: channels
    description: "Marketing channel effectiveness analysis"

measures:
  - name: cost_per_lead
    description: "Marketing spend divided by leads generated"
    sql: SUM(${campaigns.spend}) / COUNT(${leads.lead_id})
    
  - name: lead_conversion_rate
    description: "Percentage of leads that convert to opportunities"
    sql: COUNT(CASE WHEN ${leads.status} = 'Converted' THEN 1 END) / COUNT(*)
    
  - name: return_on_ad_spend
    description: "Revenue attributed to marketing divided by marketing spend"
    sql: SUM(${leads.attributed_revenue}) / SUM(${campaigns.spend})

dimensions:
  - name: campaign_type
    description: "Type of marketing campaign"
    sql: ${campaigns.type}
    
  - name: lead_source
    description: "Original source of lead generation"
    sql: ${leads.source}
```

### **Schema Inclusion Patterns**
Advanced techniques for managing complex enterprise schemas:

#### **Selective Inclusion**
```yaml
# Example: Including only specific tables from large schemas
included_schemas:
  - schema: customer_data
    include:
      - customers
      - customer_segments  
      - customer_attributes
    exclude:
      - customer_raw_events
      - customer_temp_tables
      
  - schema: transaction_data
    include:
      - transactions
      - refunds
    exclude:
      - transaction_logs
      - transaction_staging
```

#### **Conditional Inclusion**
```yaml
# Example: Environment-specific schema inclusion
included_schemas:
  - schema: production_data
    condition: "{{ target.name == 'prod' }}"
    
  - schema: development_data  
    condition: "{{ target.name == 'dev' }}"
    
  - schema: testing_data
    condition: "{{ target.name == 'test' }}"
```

#### **Dynamic Schema Management**
```yaml
# Example: Date-based schema inclusion for partition management
included_schemas:
  - schema: "events_{{ var('year') }}"
    include:
      - "events_{{ var('month') }}"
    condition: "{{ var('include_historical') }}"
```

## Enterprise Scaling Patterns

### **Large Organization Model Management**
Strategies for managing analytics across enterprise-scale organizations:

#### **Federated Development Model**
- **Central governance** - Shared standards and best practices
- **Distributed development** - Teams own their domain-specific topics
- **Cross-functional collaboration** - Shared metrics and dimensions
- **Quality assurance** - Centralized testing and validation

#### **Topic Ownership Patterns**
```yaml
# Example: Clear ownership and responsibility assignment
topics:
  - name: sales_analytics
    owner: sales_operations_team
    contributors:
      - sales_analysts
      - revenue_operations
    reviewers:
      - data_architecture_team
      
  - name: marketing_analytics
    owner: marketing_operations_team
    contributors:
      - marketing_analysts
      - demand_generation
    reviewers:
      - data_architecture_team
```

### **Performance Optimization at Scale**
Techniques for maintaining performance as models grow:

#### **Lazy Loading Strategies**
- **On-demand topic loading** - Load only topics required for specific analyses
- **Progressive enhancement** - Start with basic topics, add complexity as needed
- **Caching optimization** - Intelligent caching based on topic usage patterns
- **Resource allocation** - Distribute computational load across topic boundaries

#### **Query Optimization Patterns**
```sql
-- Example: Topic-aware query optimization
WITH sales_base AS (
  SELECT * FROM {{ topic('sales_analytics').view('opportunities') }}
  WHERE close_date >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL 90 DAY
),

marketing_attribution AS (
  SELECT * FROM {{ topic('marketing_analytics').view('attribution') }}
  WHERE attribution_date >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL 90 DAY
)

SELECT 
  sales_base.amount,
  marketing_attribution.channel,
  marketing_attribution.campaign
FROM sales_base
LEFT JOIN marketing_attribution 
  ON sales_base.opportunity_id = marketing_attribution.opportunity_id
```

## Implementation Best Practices

### **Topic Design Guidelines**
Principles for effective topic organization:

#### **Business Domain Alignment**
- **Single responsibility** - Each topic focused on one business domain
- **Clear boundaries** - Minimal overlap between topic responsibilities
- **User-centric organization** - Structure matches how business users think about data
- **Evolution capability** - Topics can grow and change with business needs

#### **Technical Excellence**
- **Performance consideration** - Topic size balanced for optimal query performance
- **Dependency management** - Clear relationships between topics
- **Documentation standards** - Consistent documentation patterns across topics
- **Testing integration** - Validation rules appropriate for each topic's complexity

### **Migration Strategy**
Moving from monolithic models to topic-based organization:

#### **Assessment Phase**
1. **Current model analysis** - Understand existing structure and complexity
2. **Business domain mapping** - Identify natural topic boundaries
3. **Dependency analysis** - Understand relationships between different areas
4. **User workflow analysis** - Map how different users interact with models

#### **Implementation Phase**
1. **Pilot topic creation** - Start with well-defined, isolated business domain
2. **Gradual migration** - Move sections of existing model to appropriate topics
3. **Testing and validation** - Ensure functionality preserved throughout transition
4. **User training** - Help users adapt to new organizational structure

#### **Optimization Phase**
1. **Performance tuning** - Optimize topic boundaries for query performance
2. **Collaboration workflow** - Establish team processes for multi-topic development
3. **Documentation enhancement** - Improve topic-level documentation and guidance
4. **Continuous improvement** - Refine organization based on user feedback

This advanced model organization approach enables analytics to scale with organizational complexity while maintaining usability and performance. By breaking complex models into manageable, domain-focused topics, organizations can democratize analytics development while preserving enterprise-grade governance and quality.

> **Architectural Insight**: The transition from monolithic models to topic-based organization mirrors the evolution of software architecture from monoliths to microservices. The benefits - improved maintainability, enhanced collaboration, and better scalability - are remarkably similar.
