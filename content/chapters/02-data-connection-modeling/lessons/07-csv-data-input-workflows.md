-- Dynamic table creation based on CSV structure
CREATE TABLE uploaded_data.customer_targets (
  customer_id STRING,
  target_revenue DECIMAL(15,2),
  target_quarter STRING,
  upload_date TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(),
  uploaded_by STRING DEFAULT CURRENT_USER(),
  version_id STRING DEFAULT GENERATE_UUID()
);

-- Automatic indexing for performance
CREATE INDEX idx_customer_targets_id ON uploaded_data.customer_targets (customer_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_customer_targets_quarter ON uploaded_data.customer_targets (target_quarter);
```

#### **Version Control and Auditing**
```sql
-- Version tracking for data changes
CREATE TABLE uploaded_data.upload_audit_log (
  upload_id STRING,
  table_name STRING,
  action_type STRING, -- 'INSERT', 'UPDATE', 'DELETE'
  user_id STRING,
  timestamp TIMESTAMP,
  row_count INTEGER,
  file_hash STRING,
  metadata JSON
);

-- Automated audit logging
CREATE TRIGGER upload_audit_trigger
  AFTER INSERT ON uploaded_data.*
  FOR EACH ROW
  INSERT INTO uploaded_data.upload_audit_log VALUES (
    NEW.upload_id,
    TABLE_NAME,
    'INSERT',
    CURRENT_USER(),
    CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(),
    1,
    FILE_HASH(),
    TO_JSON(NEW)
  );
```
