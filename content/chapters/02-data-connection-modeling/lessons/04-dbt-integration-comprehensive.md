# Comprehensive dbt Integration

This essential 19-minute presentation by Omni CTO & Co-Founder Christopher Merrick addresses one of the most critical challenges in modern data analytics: the broken dbt-BI workflow. Learn how Omni's bi-directional dbt integration solves fundamental problems that have plagued data teams for years.

## The dbt-BI Workflow Crisis

### **Why the Traditional dbt-BI Workflow is Broken**
Christopher opens with a stark reality check:

> "The dbt - BI workflow is broken. Switch to dbt, build/test/document your model, check it into version control, build it, deploy it. This can take hours. Do this for every single data set and it doesn't scale."

#### **The Traditional Pain Points**
- **Hours per model** - Simple changes require complete rebuild cycles
- **Massive context switching** - Jump between dbt Cloud, GitHub, BI tool, and database
- **Development bottlenecks** - Data teams become the constraint for all analytical needs
- **Change management overhead** - Every metric update requires formal deployment processes

#### **Scale Problems**
- **Exponential complexity** - Each new dataset multiplies the workflow overhead
- **Team dependencies** - Business users blocked by data engineering cycles
- **Innovation barriers** - Experimentation becomes too expensive in time and resources
- **Organizational friction** - Analytics becomes a cost center rather than value driver

## The Omni Solution: Bi-Directional Integration

### **What You'll Learn**
Christopher covers three critical areas:

1. **What the dbt - BI workflow should be** - A reimagined approach that serves both data engineers and business users
2. **Tips for deciding what should live in dbt vs. BI layer** - Strategic framework for architecture decisions
3. **Live demo of bi-directional dbt integration** - See the solution in action

## Video Breakdown: Comprehensive dbt Workflow

### **The Vision: Integrated Development (0:00-5:00)**
**"There's a better way"**

Christopher presents the integrated approach:
- **Unified development environment** - dbt and BI development in one interface
- **Real-time feedback loops** - See BI impact of dbt changes immediately
- **Collaborative workflows** - Data engineers and analysts work together
- **Reduced context switching** - Everything accessible from single interface

**Strategic Impact**: Development cycles reduced from hours to minutes, enabling rapid iteration and experimentation.

### **Architectural Decision Framework (5:00-10:00)**
**"What should live in dbt vs. BI layer"**

Learn the strategic framework for layer separation:

#### **dbt Layer Responsibilities**
- **Data transformation** - Complex ETL logic and data cleaning
- **Source system integration** - Raw data ingestion and standardization
- **Base model development** - Foundational tables and staging areas
- **Performance optimization** - Materialization strategies and indexing

#### **BI Layer Responsibilities**
- **Business logic** - Metrics calculation and KPI definitions
- **User experience** - Interactive analysis and exploration
- **Rapid prototyping** - Quick metric testing and validation
- **Contextual analysis** - Ad-hoc investigations and discovery

#### **Collaboration Zone**
- **Metric definitions** - Jointly developed and maintained
- **Model validation** - Testing that spans both layers
- **Documentation** - Shared understanding of business logic

- **Collaborative editing** - Multiple users working on integrated models
- **Rollback capabilities** - Safe experimentation with easy recovery

## Strategic Architecture Principles

### **Layer Separation Strategy**
Based on Christopher's framework, optimize your architecture:

#### **Raw Data Layer (dbt Primary)**
```sql
-- dbt handles complex source integration
WITH raw_events AS (
  SELECT 
    event_id,
    user_id,
    event_timestamp,
    event_type,
    properties
  FROM {{ source('analytics', 'events') }}
),

cleaned_events AS (
  SELECT 
    event_id,
    user_id,
    PARSE_TIMESTAMP('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S', event_timestamp) as event_ts,
    LOWER(event_type) as event_type,
    JSON_EXTRACT_SCALAR(properties, '$.page_url') as page_url
  FROM raw_events
  WHERE event_timestamp IS NOT NULL
)

SELECT * FROM cleaned_events
```

#### **Business Logic Layer (Omni Primary)**
```excel
// Omni handles business metrics with familiar syntax
customer_ltv = SUM(revenue) / COUNT(DISTINCT(customer_id))
churn_rate = COUNT(churned_customers) / COUNT(total_customers) 
monthly_retention = IF(previous_month_active > 0, 
                      current_month_active / previous_month_active, 
                      0)
```

#### **Integration Layer (Bi-directional)**
- **Shared metric definitions** - Consistent calculation logic
- **Unified testing** - Validation across both systems
- **Coordinated deployment** - Synchronized release cycles
- **Documentation synchronization** - Single source of truth for business logic

### **Development Workflow Optimization**

#### **Traditional Workflow Problems**
1. **dbt development** (local environment)
2. **Testing and validation** (dbt Cloud)
3. **Deployment** (production warehouse)
4. **BI development** (separate tool)
5. **User testing** (business stakeholders)
6. **Feedback integration** (back to step 1)

**Total cycle time**: Days to weeks

#### **Integrated Workflow Solution**
1. **Unified development** (Omni + dbt integration)
2. **Real-time testing** (immediate feedback)
3. **Collaborative refinement** (all stakeholders)
4. **Coordinated deployment** (single process)

**Total cycle time**: Minutes to hours
