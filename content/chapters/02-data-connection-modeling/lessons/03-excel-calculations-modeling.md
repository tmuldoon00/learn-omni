## Excel Function Categories in Omni

### **Mathematical and Statistical Functions**
Transform raw data into business insights:

#### **Basic Aggregations**
```excel
SUM(revenue)              // Total revenue
AVERAGE(deal_size)        // Mean deal size
COUNT(customers)          // Customer count
MAX(transaction_date)     // Most recent transaction
MIN(signup_date)          // First customer signup
```

#### **Advanced Statistics**
```excel
STDEV(monthly_revenue)    // Revenue volatility
PERCENTILE(deal_size, 0.9) // 90th percentile deal
MEDIAN(customer_ltv)      // Median customer value
CORREL(marketing_spend, leads) // Correlation analysis
```

### **Conditional Logic Functions**
Implement complex business rules with familiar syntax:

#### **Simple Conditions**
```excel
IF(revenue > 1000000, "Large Deal", "Standard Deal")
IF(days_since_signup > 30, "Engaged", "New")
IF(product_category = "Enterprise", revenue * 0.8, revenue * 0.9)
```

#### **Nested Logic**
```excel
IF(customer_tier = "Enterprise", 
   IF(deal_size > 100000, "Strategic", "Standard"),
   IF(deal_size > 10000, "Growth", "SMB"))
```

#### **Multi-Condition Evaluation**
```excel
IF(AND(revenue > 50000, days_active > 90), "High Value",
   IF(OR(revenue > 25000, engagement_score > 8), "Medium Value", 
       "Low Value"))
```

### **Date and Time Functions**
Handle temporal analysis with spreadsheet simplicity:

#### **Date Calculations**
```excel
DATEDIFF(close_date, opportunity_created, "days")  // Sales cycle length
YEAR(transaction_date)                             // Annual grouping
MONTH(signup_date)                                 // Monthly cohorts
WEEKDAY(order_date)                               // Day-of-week patterns
```

#### **Period Comparisons**
```excel
// Year-over-year growth
(this_year_revenue - last_year_revenue) / last_year_revenue

// Month-over-month change
(current_month - previous_month) / previous_month

// Rolling averages
AVERAGE(revenue_last_12_months)
```

### **Text and Data Manipulation**
Clean and categorize data using familiar functions:

#### **String Operations**
```excel
UPPER(customer_name)                    // Normalize case
CONCATENATE(first_name, " ", last_name) // Full name construction
LEFT(product_sku, 3)                    // Product category extraction
TRIM(company_name)                      // Remove extra spaces
```

#### **Data Categorization**
```excel
// Industry classification
IF(CONTAINS(company_name, "Bank"), "Financial Services",
   IF(CONTAINS(company_name, "Hospital"), "Healthcare", "Other"))

// Geographic grouping
IF(state IN ("CA", "OR", "WA"), "West Coast",
   IF(state IN ("NY", "NJ", "CT"), "Northeast", "Other"))
```

### **Lookup and Reference Functions**
Connect data across tables with spreadsheet-style references:

#### **Cross-Table References**
```excel
VLOOKUP(customer_id, customer_table, "industry")  // Customer industry
INDEX(product_table, product_id, "margin")        // Product margin
MATCH(territory, territory_table, "manager")      // Territory manager
```

#### **Dynamic Calculations**
```excel
// Customer lifetime value
customer_monthly_revenue * VLOOKUP(customer_tier, ltv_table, "multiplier")

// Territory performance
SUM(deals_won) / VLOOKUP(territory, quota_table, "annual_quota")
```

## Business Use Case Examples
