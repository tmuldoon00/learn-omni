# Data Input and CSV Management

Not all data analysis starts with perfectly structured warehouse tables. Sometimes you need to bring in external data, create lookup tables, or even write data back to your warehouse. Omni's Data Input capabilities solve these challenges without adding to the data team's backlog.

## The Challenge: Data Integration Gap

Data teams often face requests like:
- **External Data Integration** - "Can we bring in this spreadsheet from our vendor?"
- **Quick Lookup Tables** - "I need to map these product codes to categories"
- **Data Corrections** - "We found errors in the warehouse data that need fixing"
- **Prototype Data** - "Can we test with this sample dataset before building the full pipeline?"

Traditional solutions require data engineering work, creating bottlenecks and delays.

## Data Input Capabilities

### CSV Upload and Management
- **Drag-and-Drop Upload** - Bring any CSV file directly into Omni
- **Schema Detection** - Automatic data type inference and column mapping
- **Data Validation** - Built-in checks for data quality and consistency
- **Version Control** - Track changes and updates to uploaded datasets

### Interactive Data Entry
- **Spreadsheet Interface** - Familiar Excel-like editing experience
- **Real-time Validation** - Immediate feedback on data quality
- **Collaborative Editing** - Multiple users can contribute to datasets
- **Mobile-Friendly** - Update data from any device

### Warehouse Write-Back
- **Direct Integration** - Data flows directly to your warehouse tables
- **Automatic Syncing** - Changes reflect immediately in downstream analyses
- **Security Compliance** - All warehouse permissions and security rules apply
- **Audit Trail** - Complete tracking of data modifications

## Use Cases and Applications

### Vendor Data Integration
**Scenario:** Marketing team receives monthly performance data from advertising partners
- Upload CSV files directly to Omni
- Map columns to standardized schema
- Join with existing campaign data
- Automate monthly reporting process

### Product Information Management
**Scenario:** Product team needs to maintain category mappings and specifications
- Create interactive lookup tables
- Enable team members to add/edit product information
- Automatically sync changes to warehouse
- Maintain data quality with validation rules

### Financial Planning and Budgeting
**Scenario:** Finance team creates budget forecasts and variance analysis
- Upload budget data from planning tools
- Create editable forecast models
- Compare actuals vs. budget in real-time
- Enable scenario planning with data input

### Customer Data Enrichment
**Scenario:** Sales team has additional customer insights not in the CRM
- Create customer attribute tables
- Allow sales reps to add context and notes
- Enrich analytics with qualitative insights
- Maintain customer data completeness

## Technical Implementation

### Data Processing Pipeline
```
CSV Upload → Schema Detection → Data Validation → Warehouse Integration → Analytics Access
```

### Security and Governance
- **User Permissions** - Control who can upload and modify data
- **Data Classification** - Apply appropriate security labels
- **Compliance Checks** - Ensure data meets regulatory requirements
- **Access Logging** - Complete audit trail for all data operations

### Performance Optimization
- **Incremental Updates** - Only process changed data
- **Batch Processing** - Efficient handling of large datasets
- **Caching Strategy** - Fast access to frequently used data
- **Resource Management** - Automatic cleanup of unused datasets

## Best Practices

### Data Quality Standards
1. **Consistent Naming** - Use standardized column names and formats
2. **Data Validation** - Implement checks for required fields and data types
3. **Documentation** - Include metadata and descriptions for all datasets
4. **Version Control** - Track changes and maintain historical versions

### Workflow Integration
1. **Approval Process** - Implement review workflows for sensitive data
2. **Notification System** - Alert stakeholders when data is updated
3. **Backup Strategy** - Maintain copies of critical external datasets
4. **Monitoring** - Track usage and performance of uploaded data

### Collaboration Guidelines
1. **Clear Ownership** - Assign responsibility for each dataset
2. **Update Schedules** - Establish regular refresh cadences
3. **Communication** - Notify users of significant changes
4. **Training** - Ensure team members understand proper procedures
