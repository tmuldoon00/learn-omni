# Natural Language Calculations with AI

One of the biggest barriers to advanced analytics is the complexity of writing calculations and formulas. Omni's ChatGPT integration for spreadsheet calculations removes this barrier entirely, allowing you to describe what you want to calculate in plain English and get precise Excel-compatible formulas instantly.

## The Power of Natural Language Calculations

### Breaking Down Technical Barriers
Traditional analytics tools require users to:
- Learn complex formula syntax
- Understand mathematical operations
- Remember function names and parameters
- Debug formula errors manually

With ChatGPT integration, you simply describe your calculation needs in natural language.

### Excel Syntax Advantage
Omni's calculations use syntactic parity with Excel and Google Sheets, which provides a huge advantage:
- **Familiar Interface** - Users already know Excel formulas
- **Rich Documentation** - Extensive online resources and tutorials available
- **AI Training Data** - ChatGPT has deep knowledge of Excel functions from web content
- **Transferable Skills** - Knowledge applies across multiple tools

## How Natural Language Calculations Work

### Simple Descriptions
Instead of writing complex formulas, describe what you want:

**Traditional Approach:**
```excel
=IF(AND(B2>1000, C2>0.1), "High Value", IF(AND(B2>500, C2>0.05), "Medium Value", "Low Value"))
```

**Natural Language Approach:**
> "Create a customer value category where deals over $1000 with 10%+ margin are High Value, deals over $500 with 5%+ margin are Medium Value, and everything else is Low Value"

### Advanced Analytics Made Simple

**Complex Financial Calculations:**
> "Calculate the net present value of this deal using a 10% discount rate over 3 years with monthly payments"

**Statistical Analysis:**
> "Find the rolling 90-day average with outlier detection, marking values more than 2 standard deviations from the mean"

**Date and Time Logic:**
> "Calculate business days between order date and delivery date, excluding weekends and US holidays"

## Practical Applications

### Sales Performance Analysis

**Commission Calculations:**
> "Calculate commission where base rate is 5%, plus 2% bonus for deals over $10K, plus 1% additional for Q4 deals"

**Territory Performance:**
> "Create a ranking system where territories get points for revenue (1 point per $1000), deal count (10 points per deal), and customer satisfaction (20 points per rating point above 4.0)"

### Financial Reporting

**Variance Analysis:**
> "Calculate budget variance as both dollar amount and percentage, with color coding: green for within 5%, yellow for 5-15% variance, red for over 15%"

**Growth Metrics:**
> "Calculate year-over-year growth rate, quarter-over-quarter growth rate, and compound annual growth rate for the last 3 years"

### Customer Analytics

**Cohort Analysis:**
> "Group customers by signup month and calculate monthly retention rates for each cohort over 12 months"

**Lifetime Value Prediction:**
> "Estimate customer lifetime value using average monthly revenue, churn rate, and gross margin, adjusted for acquisition cost"
