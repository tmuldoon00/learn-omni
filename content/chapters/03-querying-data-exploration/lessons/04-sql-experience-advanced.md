# Advanced SQL Experience

This focused 4-minute demonstration showcases Omni's sophisticated SQL interface, representing the final evolution of their SQL experience design. Watch as the video reveals clearer transitions from UI to SQL, comprehensive UI assistance for moving between different query modes, and a professional development environment that bridges visual and code-based analytics.

## The Evolution of SQL in Modern BI

### **Why SQL Experience Matters**
SQL remains the foundation of enterprise analytics, but traditional BI tools create artificial barriers:
- **Context switching** - Jarring transitions between visual and code interfaces
- **Lost work** - Visual queries disappear when switching to SQL mode
- **Limited assistance** - Minimal help bridging between different interface types
- **Technical isolation** - SQL users separated from visual analytics workflows

### **Omni's Revolutionary SQL Integration**
This video shows the culmination of extensive development to create seamless SQL experiences:
- **Smooth transitions** - Move fluidly between UI and SQL without losing context
- **Bidirectional development** - Build visually, enhance with SQL, return to visual
- **Professional tooling** - Enterprise-grade SQL development environment

## Technical Architecture: SQL Excellence

### **Bidirectional Translation Engine**
Understanding how visual and SQL interfaces stay synchronized:

#### **UI-to-SQL Conversion**
```sql
-- Visual query: Show revenue by month for last 6 months, filtered to enterprise customers
-- Automatically generated SQL:

SELECT 
  DATE_TRUNC('month', order_date) as month,
  SUM(order_amount) as total_revenue
FROM orders o
JOIN customers c ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id
WHERE c.customer_tier = 'Enterprise'
  AND order_date >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '6 months'
GROUP BY DATE_TRUNC('month', order_date)
ORDER BY month DESC
```

#### **SQL-to-UI Interpretation**
```sql
-- User-written SQL
SELECT 
  product_category,
  customer_tier,
  AVG(order_amount) as avg_order_value,
  COUNT(*) as order_count
FROM orders o
JOIN customers c ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id
JOIN products p ON o.product_id = p.product_id  
WHERE order_date >= '2024-01-01'
GROUP BY product_category, customer_tier
HAVING COUNT(*) > 10

-- Automatically creates visual interface with:
-- - Dimensions: product_category, customer_tier
-- - Measures: avg_order_value, order_count
-- - Filters: order_date >= '2024-01-01'
-- - Table filter: order_count > 10
```

### **Professional SQL Development Features**
Enterprise-grade tools for SQL development:

#### **Advanced Code Editor**
- **Multi-cursor editing** - Edit multiple parts of query simultaneously
- **Code folding** - Collapse complex subqueries for better organization
- **Find and replace** - Sophisticated text manipulation across large queries
- **Code formatting** - Automatic SQL beautification and standardization

#### **Query Performance Tools**
```sql
-- Execution plan analysis
EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS) 
SELECT 
  customer_tier,
  DATE_TRUNC('month', order_date) as month,
  SUM(order_amount) as revenue
FROM orders o
JOIN customers c ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id
WHERE order_date >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '12 months'
GROUP BY customer_tier, DATE_TRUNC('month', order_date)

-- Performance recommendations appear inline:
-- ✓ Index suggestion: CREATE INDEX ON orders(order_date, customer_id)
-- ✓ Partition pruning: Query efficiently uses date partitions
-- ⚠ Join optimization: Consider materialized view for frequent customer joins
```

#### **Collaborative SQL Development**
- **Version control integration** - Track changes and collaborate through Git
- **Comment and annotation** - Document complex query logic inline
- **Query sharing** - Send SQL queries to team members with context
- **Code review workflows** - Systematic quality assurance for complex queries

## Advanced SQL Features and Capabilities

### **Enterprise Query Patterns**
Sophisticated SQL patterns made accessible:

#### **Complex Analytical Queries**
```sql
-- Customer cohort analysis with retention rates
WITH monthly_cohorts AS (
  SELECT 
    customer_id,
    DATE_TRUNC('month', first_order_date) as cohort_month
  FROM (
    SELECT 
      customer_id,
      MIN(order_date) as first_order_date
    FROM orders
    GROUP BY customer_id
  ) first_orders
),

monthly_activity AS (
  SELECT 
    o.customer_id,
    DATE_TRUNC('month', o.order_date) as activity_month,
    SUM(o.order_amount) as monthly_revenue
  FROM orders o
  GROUP BY o.customer_id, DATE_TRUNC('month', o.order_date)
),

cohort_data AS (
  SELECT 
    mc.cohort_month,
    ma.activity_month,
    COUNT(DISTINCT ma.customer_id) as active_customers,
    SUM(ma.monthly_revenue) as cohort_revenue,
    DATE_PART('month', AGE(ma.activity_month, mc.cohort_month)) as months_since_first_order
  FROM monthly_cohorts mc
  LEFT JOIN monthly_activity ma ON mc.customer_id = ma.customer_id
  GROUP BY mc.cohort_month, ma.activity_month
)

SELECT 
  cohort_month,
  months_since_first_order,
  active_customers,
  cohort_revenue,
  active_customers / FIRST_VALUE(active_customers) 
    OVER (PARTITION BY cohort_month ORDER BY months_since_first_order) as retention_rate
FROM cohort_data
WHERE months_since_first_order <= 12
ORDER BY cohort_month, months_since_first_order
```

#### **Advanced Window Functions**
```sql
-- Sales performance analysis with rankings and moving averages
SELECT 
  sales_rep,
  month,
  monthly_revenue,
  
  -- Ranking within each month
  RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY month ORDER BY monthly_revenue DESC) as monthly_rank,
  
  -- Moving averages
  AVG(monthly_revenue) OVER (
    PARTITION BY sales_rep 
    ORDER BY month 
    ROWS BETWEEN 2 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
  ) as three_month_avg,
  
  -- Year-over-year comparison
  LAG(monthly_revenue, 12) OVER (
    PARTITION BY sales_rep 
    ORDER BY month
  ) as same_month_last_year,
  
  -- Cumulative metrics
  SUM(monthly_revenue) OVER (
    PARTITION BY sales_rep, DATE_PART('year', month)
    ORDER BY month
  ) as ytd_revenue,
  
  -- Percentile analysis
  PERCENT_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY monthly_revenue) as revenue_percentile
  
FROM monthly_sales_summary
ORDER BY sales_rep, month
```

### **Database-Specific Optimizations**
Leveraging unique capabilities of different data warehouses:

#### **Snowflake-Specific Features**
```sql
-- Using Snowflake's FLATTEN function for JSON processing
SELECT 
  order_id,
  customer_id,
  f.value:product_id::STRING as product_id,
  f.value:quantity::NUMBER as quantity,
  f.value:unit_price::NUMBER as unit_price
FROM orders,
LATERAL FLATTEN(input => order_items) f
WHERE order_date >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '30 days'

-- Time travel capabilities
SELECT *
FROM customers AT (TIMESTAMP => '2024-01-01 00:00:00')
WHERE customer_tier = 'Enterprise'

-- Clustering optimization
SELECT 
  DATE_TRUNC('day', order_date) as order_day,
  customer_tier,
  COUNT(*) as order_count,
  SUM(order_amount) as daily_revenue
FROM orders
WHERE order_date >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '90 days'
GROUP BY DATE_TRUNC('day', order_date), customer_tier
ORDER BY order_day DESC, customer_tier
```

#### **BigQuery-Specific Capabilities**
```sql
-- Using BigQuery's array functions
SELECT 
  customer_id,
  ARRAY_AGG(
    STRUCT(
      product_id, 
      product_name, 
      order_amount
    )
    ORDER BY order_date DESC
    LIMIT 5
  ) as recent_purchases
FROM orders o
JOIN products p ON o.product_id = p.product_id
WHERE order_date >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL 90 DAY
GROUP BY customer_id

-- Geographic functions
SELECT 
  customer_city,
  customer_state,
  ST_DISTANCE(
    ST_GEOGPOINT(customer_longitude, customer_latitude),
    ST_GEOGPOINT(-122.4194, 37.7749)  -- San Francisco coordinates
  ) / 1000 as distance_from_sf_km
FROM customers
WHERE customer_country = 'United States'
```
