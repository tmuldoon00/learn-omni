## Technical Architecture: JSON Processing Engine

### **Visual JSON Parser**
Understanding the sophisticated technology behind simple interfaces:

#### **Automatic Schema Detection**
```javascript
// Complex JSON structure automatically analyzed
const apiResponse = {
  "customer": {
    "id": "cust_12345",
    "profile": {
      "name": "John Smith",
      "tier": "enterprise",
      "metrics": {
        "lifetime_value": 25000,
        "last_activity": "2024-01-15T14:30:00Z"
      }
    },
    "orders": [
      {
        "order_id": "ord_001",
        "amount": 1500,
        "products": ["prod_a", "prod_b"]
      },
      {
        "order_id": "ord_002", 
        "amount": 2300,
        "products": ["prod_c"]
      }
    ]
  }
}

// Omni automatically generates extractable paths:
// customer.id -> String
// customer.profile.name -> String
// customer.profile.tier -> String  
// customer.profile.metrics.lifetime_value -> Number
// customer.profile.metrics.last_activity -> DateTime
// customer.orders[*].order_id -> String Array
// customer.orders[*].amount -> Number Array
// customer.orders[*].products[*] -> String Array
```

#### **Smart Extraction Engine**
```sql
-- User clicks to extract customer.profile.metrics.lifetime_value
-- Omni automatically generates optimized SQL:

SELECT 
  raw_data,
  JSON_EXTRACT(raw_data, '$.customer.profile.metrics.lifetime_value') as customer_ltv,
  JSON_EXTRACT(raw_data, '$.customer.profile.name') as customer_name,
  JSON_EXTRACT(raw_data, '$.customer.profile.tier') as customer_tier
FROM api_responses
WHERE JSON_EXTRACT(raw_data, '$.customer.profile.metrics.lifetime_value') IS NOT NULL
```

### **Array Processing Intelligence**
Handling complex JSON arrays and nested structures:

#### **Automatic Array Flattening**
```sql
-- User selects orders array for analysis
-- System automatically generates:

WITH flattened_orders AS (
  SELECT 
    JSON_EXTRACT(raw_data, '$.customer.id') as customer_id,
    JSON_EXTRACT(raw_data, '$.customer.profile.name') as customer_name,
    order_data.value as order_json
  FROM api_responses,
  LATERAL FLATTEN(input => JSON_EXTRACT(raw_data, '$.customer.orders')) as order_data
)

SELECT 
  customer_id,
  customer_name,
  JSON_EXTRACT(order_json, '$.order_id') as order_id,
  JSON_EXTRACT(order_json, '$.amount')::NUMBER as order_amount,
  JSON_EXTRACT(order_json, '$.products') as products_json
FROM flattened_orders
```

#### **Nested Product Analysis**
```sql
-- Further flattening for product-level analysis
WITH product_level AS (
  SELECT 
    customer_id,
    order_id,
    order_amount,
    product_data.value::STRING as product_id
  FROM flattened_orders,
  LATERAL FLATTEN(input => JSON_EXTRACT(order_json, '$.products')) as product_data
)

SELECT 
  customer_id,
  COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) as total_orders,
  COUNT(DISTINCT product_id) as unique_products,
  SUM(order_amount) as total_revenue
FROM product_level
GROUP BY customer_id
```

## Advanced JSON Processing Features

### **Complex Data Type Handling**
Sophisticated processing of various JSON data types:

#### **Date and Time Processing**
```json
// Complex timestamp handling
{
  "events": [
    {
      "timestamp": "2024-01-15T14:30:00.123Z",
      "event_type": "page_view",
      "duration_ms": 45000
    }
  ]
}
```

```sql
-- Automatic date conversion and timezone handling
SELECT 
  JSON_EXTRACT(raw_data, '$.events[0].timestamp')::TIMESTAMP as event_time,
  CONVERT_TIMEZONE('UTC', 'America/New_York', 
    JSON_EXTRACT(raw_data, '$.events[0].timestamp')::TIMESTAMP
  ) as event_time_et,
  JSON_EXTRACT(raw_data, '$.events[0].duration_ms')::NUMBER / 1000 as duration_seconds
FROM event_logs
```

#### **Geographic Data Processing**
```json
// Location data extraction
{
  "user_location": {
    "coordinates": {
      "latitude": 37.7749,
      "longitude": -122.4194
    },
    "address": {
      "city": "San Francisco",
      "state": "CA",
      "country": "US"
    }
  }
}
```

```sql
-- Geographic analysis capabilities
SELECT 
  JSON_EXTRACT(raw_data, '$.user_location.coordinates.latitude')::FLOAT as lat,
  JSON_EXTRACT(raw_data, '$.user_location.coordinates.longitude')::FLOAT as lng,
  JSON_EXTRACT(raw_data, '$.user_location.address.city') as city,
  ST_DISTANCE(
    ST_POINT(lng, lat),
    ST_POINT(-122.4194, 37.7749)  -- San Francisco
  ) / 1000 as distance_from_sf_km
FROM user_events
```

### **Performance Optimization**
Efficient processing of large JSON datasets:

#### **Selective Extraction**
```sql
-- Only extract needed fields to optimize performance
SELECT 
  -- Core business metrics only
  JSON_EXTRACT(raw_data, '$.customer.id') as customer_id,
  JSON_EXTRACT(raw_data, '$.transaction.amount')::NUMBER as amount,
  JSON_EXTRACT(raw_data, '$.transaction.date')::DATE as transaction_date
FROM transaction_logs
WHERE JSON_EXTRACT(raw_data, '$.transaction.amount')::NUMBER > 1000
  AND JSON_EXTRACT(raw_data, '$.transaction.date')::DATE >= CURRENT_DATE - 30
```

#### **Materialized JSON Views**
```sql
-- Create optimized views for frequently accessed JSON paths
CREATE VIEW customer_metrics AS
SELECT 
  JSON_EXTRACT(raw_data, '$.customer.id') as customer_id,
  JSON_EXTRACT(raw_data, '$.customer.profile.tier') as tier,
  JSON_EXTRACT(raw_data, '$.customer.metrics.lifetime_value')::NUMBER as ltv,
  JSON_EXTRACT(raw_data, '$.customer.metrics.last_activity')::TIMESTAMP as last_activity,
  raw_data  -- Keep original for ad-hoc extraction
FROM customer_api_data
WHERE JSON_EXTRACT(raw_data, '$.customer.id') IS NOT NULL
```
