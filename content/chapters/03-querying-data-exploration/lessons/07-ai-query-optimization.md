## Technical Architecture: AI Reliability Engineering

### **Multi-Layer Retry System**
Understanding the sophisticated approach to ensuring query success:

#### **Primary Query Attempt**
```python
# Initial AI query processing
def process_natural_language_query(user_query, context):
    try:
        # Parse user intent
        parsed_intent = nlp_parser.parse(user_query, context)
        
        # Generate initial query
        sql_query = query_generator.generate(parsed_intent, semantic_model)
        
        # Validate query logic
        validation_result = validator.check_query(sql_query, semantic_model)
        
        if validation_result.is_valid:
            return execute_query(sql_query)
        else:
            raise QueryValidationError(validation_result.errors)
            
    except (ParseError, GenerationError, ValidationError) as e:
        # Trigger retry mechanism
        return initiate_retry_sequence(user_query, context, e)
```

#### **Intelligent Retry Mechanism**
```python
# Multi-stage retry with different strategies
def initiate_retry_sequence(user_query, context, original_error):
    retry_strategies = [
        SimplificationRetry(),      # Simplify complex queries
        DisambiguationRetry(),      # Handle ambiguous terms
        ContextEnhancementRetry(),  # Add more context
        FallbackQueryRetry(),       # Use simpler query patterns
        HumanReadableErrorRetry()   # Provide helpful error messages
    ]
    
    for strategy in retry_strategies:
        try:
            result = strategy.attempt_query(user_query, context, original_error)
            if result.success:
                # Log successful retry strategy for learning
                log_successful_retry(strategy, user_query, result)
                return result
        except Exception as retry_error:
            continue
    
    # If all retries fail, provide intelligent error message
    return generate_helpful_error_response(user_query, context)
```

### **Enhanced Filter Intelligence**
Advanced temporal and contextual filter processing:

#### **Temporal Filter Processing**
```python
# Sophisticated time filter interpretation
class TemporalFilterProcessor:
    def process_time_expression(self, expression, current_date, business_calendar):
        time_patterns = {
            'last_month': self.get_previous_month_range,
            'this_quarter': self.get_current_quarter_range,
            'year_over_year': self.get_yoy_comparison_range,
            'rolling_12_months': self.get_rolling_year_range,
            'fiscal_year': self.get_fiscal_year_range
        }
        
        # Handle business calendar complexity
        if 'fiscal' in expression.lower():
            return self.apply_fiscal_calendar(expression, business_calendar)
        
        # Handle relative dates with business day awareness
        if 'business_days' in expression or 'weekdays' in expression:
            return self.apply_business_day_filter(expression, current_date)
        
        # Handle seasonal patterns
        if any(season in expression.lower() for season in ['seasonal', 'holiday', 'peak']):
            return self.apply_seasonal_context(expression, business_calendar)
    
    def get_previous_month_range(self, current_date):
        # Complex logic to handle month boundaries, leap years, etc.
        first_of_current = current_date.replace(day=1)
        last_month_end = first_of_current - timedelta(days=1)
        last_month_start = last_month_end.replace(day=1)
        
        return {
            'start_date': last_month_start,
            'end_date': last_month_end,
            'filter_sql': f"date_column BETWEEN '{last_month_start}' AND '{last_month_end}'"
        }
```

#### **Context-Aware Filter Enhancement**
```python
# Intelligent filter context application
class ContextualFilterEnhancer:
    def enhance_filters(self, base_filters, semantic_context, user_history):
        enhanced_filters = base_filters.copy()
        
        # Add implicit filters based on user role
        if semantic_context.user_role == 'sales_manager':
            enhanced_filters.add_territory_filter(semantic_context.user_territory)
        
        # Add business logic filters
        if 'revenue' in base_filters.metrics:
            enhanced_filters.add_active_customer_filter()
            enhanced_filters.exclude_test_transactions()
        
        # Apply data quality filters
        enhanced_filters.add_data_completeness_filter()
        
        # Historical context enhancement
        if user_history.frequently_filters_by('customer_tier'):
            enhanced_filters.suggest_customer_tier_breakdown()
        
        return enhanced_filters
```

        # Check for reasonable value ranges
        for metric in query.metrics:
            metric_definition = semantic_model.get_metric(metric)
            if metric_definition.has_expected_range():
                validation_checks.append(
                    self.validate_value_range(results[metric], metric_definition.range)
                )
        
        # Check for logical consistency
        if 'total' in query.metrics and 'components' in query.metrics:

        # Statistical anomaly detection
        for metric in current_results.metrics:
            z_score = self.calculate_z_score(
                current_results[metric], 
                historical_patterns[metric]
            )

            )
        
        # Temporal anomalies
        if context.has_time_dimension():
            temporal_anomalies = self.detect_temporal_anomalies(
                current_results, historical_patterns
            )
            anomalies.extend(temporal_anomalies)
        
        return anomalies

                user_query, ai_result, user_feedback.corrected_query
            )
        
        # Identify improvement opportunities
        if user_feedback.rating < 3:
            self.failure_patterns.analyze_failure(
                user_query, ai_result, user_feedback.issues
            )

        }
        
        self.filter_performance_history[filter_type].append(
            PerformanceRecord(user_query, performance_metrics, timestamp.now())
        )
        
        # Identify improvement opportunities
        if performance_metrics['recall'] < 0.9:  # Less than 90% recall
            self.flag_for_improvement(filter_type, user_query, performance_metrics)
        
        # Update filter algorithms

    "When should I expect to reach my subscription limit?"
]

# Enhanced error handling for customer-facing scenarios
def process_customer_query(query, customer_context):
    try:
        result = ai_engine.process_query(query, customer_context)
        
        # Additional customer-specific validation
        if not result.contains_customer_data(customer_context.customer_id):
