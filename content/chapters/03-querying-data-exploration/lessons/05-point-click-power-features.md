## Technical Architecture: Power Behind the Interface

### **Automated SQL Generation**
Understanding how simple clicks become sophisticated queries:

#### **Running Totals Implementation**
```sql
-- User clicks "Running Total" on revenue by month
-- Omni automatically generates:

SELECT 
  month,
  revenue,
  SUM(revenue) OVER (
    ORDER BY month 
    ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
  ) as running_total_revenue
FROM monthly_revenue
ORDER BY month
```

#### **Ranking Calculations**
```sql
-- User clicks "Rank" on sales rep performance
-- Automatically generates:

SELECT 
  sales_rep,
  monthly_revenue,
  RANK() OVER (ORDER BY monthly_revenue DESC) as revenue_rank,
  PERCENT_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY monthly_revenue DESC) as revenue_percentile
FROM sales_performance
ORDER BY revenue_rank
```

#### **Percentage Change Analysis**
```sql
-- User selects "% Change from Previous" on quarterly metrics
-- System creates:

SELECT 
  quarter,
  revenue,
  LAG(revenue) OVER (ORDER BY quarter) as previous_quarter_revenue,
  (revenue - LAG(revenue) OVER (ORDER BY quarter)) / 
    LAG(revenue) OVER (ORDER BY quarter) * 100 as percent_change
FROM quarterly_performance
ORDER BY quarter
```

### **Performance Optimization Engine**
How point-and-click operations maintain enterprise performance:

#### **Intelligent Query Optimization**
- **Index utilization** - Automatically leverage optimal database indexes
- **Partition pruning** - Limit queries to relevant data partitions
- **Join optimization** - Efficient table relationships regardless of user selections
- **Memory management** - Optimal resource allocation for complex calculations

#### **Caching Strategies**
- **Result caching** - Store common calculation results for instant retrieval
- **Incremental updates** - Update only changed data rather than recalculating everything
- **User-specific optimization** - Tailor performance to individual usage patterns
- **Predictive pre-calculation** - Anticipate likely next calculations
