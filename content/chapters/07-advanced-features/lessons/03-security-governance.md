# Security and Development Lifecycle Controls

Modern data teams need sophisticated workflows for safely testing and deploying changes at any scale. This lesson demonstrates how Omni's software development lifecycle (SDLC) controls enable data analysts and engineers to manage changes to data, pull those changes into BI tools, and update related content following enterprise-grade practices.

## The Challenge: Safe Data Deployment

Data teams face constant pressure to:
- **Deploy Changes Safely** - Test modifications without breaking production dashboards
- **Maintain Data Quality** - Ensure schema changes don't corrupt existing analyses
- **Collaborate Effectively** - Allow multiple team members to work on models simultaneously
- **Track Changes** - Understand what changed, when, and by whom

## SDLC Workflow in Practice

### Development Environment
- **Isolated Testing** - Make changes in development branches without affecting production
- **Schema Evolution** - Test database changes before they impact live dashboards
- **Model Validation** - Verify semantic model changes work as expected

### Testing and Validation
- **Automated Checks** - Run validation rules on model changes
- **Content Impact Analysis** - Understand which dashboards will be affected
- **Rollback Capability** - Quick recovery if issues are discovered

### Production Deployment
- **Controlled Rollouts** - Deploy changes incrementally
- **Change Tracking** - Complete audit trail of modifications
- **Impact Monitoring** - Watch for issues post-deployment

## Software Development Best Practices

**Version Control Integration:**
- Branch-based development for all model changes
- Pull request reviews for quality control
- Automated testing before merge

**Change Management:**
- Impact analysis before deployment
- Rollback procedures for quick recovery
- Documentation of all changes

**Collaboration Workflows:**
- Multiple developers working safely
- Conflict resolution procedures
- Code review processes

## Enterprise Governance

### Security Controls
- **Row-Level Security** - Users see only data they're authorized to access
- **Field-Level Permissions** - Hide sensitive columns from specific users
- **Query Audit Trails** - Complete logging of data access

### Content Management
- **Version Control** - Track all changes to models and dashboards
- **Access Controls** - Granular permissions on folders and content
- **Change Approval** - Require review for sensitive modifications

## Implementation Strategy

1. **Establish Branching Strategy** - Define development, staging, and production environments
2. **Set Up Validation Rules** - Create automated checks for common issues
3. **Train Team Members** - Ensure everyone understands the workflow
4. **Monitor and Iterate** - Continuously improve processes based on experience

These SDLC controls transform ad-hoc data analysis into professional software development practices, enabling teams to scale analytics operations while maintaining reliability and security.
