# dbt and Git Integration

Modern data teams rely on dbt (data build tool) for transforming data and Git for version control. Omni's deep integration with both tools creates a seamless workflow that bridges the gap between data engineering and analytics, enabling collaborative development at enterprise scale.

## Why dbt and Git Integration Matters

### The Modern Data Stack Challenge

#### Traditional Workflow Problems
❌ **Siloed Development** - Analytics separate from data engineering workflows
❌ **Manual Sync** - Schema changes require manual BI tool updates
❌ **No Version Control** - BI logic lives outside of version control systems
❌ **Deployment Complexity** - Multiple tools with different deployment processes
❌ **Knowledge Silos** - Data engineers and analysts work in isolation

#### Integrated Workflow Benefits
✅ **Unified Development** - Single workflow for data models and BI logic
✅ **Automatic Sync** - Schema changes propagate automatically to Omni
✅ **Version Control Everything** - BI logic alongside data transformations
✅ **Streamlined Deployment** - Coordinated releases across the data stack
✅ **Collaborative Development** - Engineers and analysts working together

### Business Impact of Integration

#### Development Velocity
- **Faster Time to Market:** New metrics deployed in days, not weeks
- **Reduced Context Switching:** Single development environment
- **Automated Testing:** Data quality checks integrated with BI validation
- **Consistent Deployment:** Coordinated releases reduce errors

#### Quality and Governance
- **Single Source of Truth:** Data definitions shared across tools
- **Automated Documentation:** Business context flows from dbt to Omni
- **Change Management:** Git workflow ensures proper review processes
- **Rollback Capabilities:** Easy reversion when issues arise

## dbt Integration Architecture

### Three Pillars of Integration

#### 1. Seamless Data Sync
```yaml
# Automatic schema synchronization
sync_features:
  - "New tables and columns appear automatically in Omni"
  - "View descriptions from dbt propagate to Omni"
  - "Schema changes trigger Omni model refresh"
  - "Data lineage preserved across tools"

workflow:
  1. "Developer updates dbt model"
  2. "dbt run creates/updates database objects"
  3. "Omni automatically detects schema changes"
  4. "Model refreshes with new structure"
  5. "BI content adapts to schema changes"
```

#### 2. Bidirectional Development
```yaml
# Push changes from Omni back to dbt
omni_to_dbt:
  - "Export successful analytics logic as dbt models"
  - "Convert Omni metrics to dbt macros"
  - "Generate dbt documentation from Omni business context"
  - "Create dbt tests based on Omni data validation"

development_flow:
  prototype: "Rapid analysis in Omni workbooks"
  validate: "Business stakeholder approval"  
  promote: "Export to dbt for production deployment"
  standardize: "dbt handles data quality and governance"
```

#### 3. Environment Management
```yaml
# Multiple environment support
environment_strategy:
  development:
    dbt_target: "dev"
    omni_model: "development_model"
    purpose: "Safe experimentation and testing"
    
  staging:
    dbt_target: "staging"
    omni_model: "staging_model"
    purpose: "Pre-production validation"
    
  production:
    dbt_target: "prod"
    omni_model: "production_model"
    purpose: "Live business reporting"
```

### Technical Integration Points

#### Schema Synchronization
```sql
-- dbt model with rich metadata
{{ config(
    materialized='table',
    description='Customer metrics aggregated daily for reporting'
) }}

SELECT 
  customer_id,
  order_date,
  
  -- Omni inherits these descriptions automatically
  sum(order_amount) as total_revenue, -- "Total customer spend for the day"
  count(*) as order_count,           -- "Number of orders placed"
  avg(order_amount) as avg_order_value -- "Average order size"
  
FROM {{ ref('orders') }}
GROUP BY customer_id, order_date
```

#### Business Context Flow
```yaml
# dbt metadata flows to Omni automatically
dbt_model: customer_daily_metrics
description: "Customer metrics aggregated daily for reporting"

omni_topic: Customer Analytics  
inherited_context:
  - description: "Customer metrics aggregated daily for reporting"
  - field_descriptions: "Inherited from dbt column comments"
  - data_lineage: "Traced back to source tables via dbt"
  - update_frequency: "Daily via dbt scheduled runs"
```

## Git Integration Workflow

### Version Control for Analytics

#### Everything in Git
```
repository/
├── dbt/
│   ├── models/
│   │   ├── marts/
│   │   └── staging/
│   ├── macros/
│   ├── tests/
│   └── dbt_project.yml
├── omni/

    ├── staging.yml
    └── production.yml
```

#### Coordinated Development Process
```yaml
# Feature branch workflow
feature_development:
  1_create_branch: "git checkout -b feature/customer-segmentation"
  2_dbt_development: "Build new customer segmentation models"
  3_omni_development: "Create analytics on top of new models"
  4_testing: "Validate data quality and BI logic together"
  5_pull_request: "Review both data and analytics changes"
  6_deployment: "Deploy dbt and Omni changes simultaneously"
```

### Branch-Based Analytics Development

#### Omni Branch Mode Integration
```yaml
# Omni branches sync with Git branches
git_branch: "feature/revenue-attribution"
omni_branch: "feature/revenue-attribution"

development_flow:
  1. "Create Git feature branch"
  2. "Omni automatically creates corresponding branch"
  3. "Develop dbt models and Omni analytics in parallel"
  4. "Test changes in isolated environment"
  5. "Submit pull request for code review"
  6. "Deploy both systems simultaneously"

branch_benefits:
  - "Complete isolation of changes"
  - "Safe experimentation without production impact"
  - "Coordinated testing of data and analytics logic"
  - "Atomic deployment of full-stack changes"
```

#### Git Workflow Enforcement
```yaml
# Git integration enforces best practices
workflow_controls:
  - "All changes must go through pull requests"
  - "Direct commits to main branch prevented"
  - "Automated testing runs on all branches"
  - "Deployment only from approved branches"

quality_gates:
  - "dbt tests must pass"
  - "Omni model validation must succeed"
  - "Performance regression tests"
  - "Documentation completeness checks"
```

## Advanced Integration Patterns

### Metric Consistency Across Tools

#### Single Definition, Multiple Uses
```sql
-- dbt macro defines business logic
{% macro monthly_recurring_revenue() %}
  sum(case 
    when subscription_type = 'monthly' then subscription_amount
    when subscription_type = 'annual' then subscription_amount / 12
    else 0 
  end)
{% endmacro %}

-- Used in dbt model
SELECT 
  date_month,
  {{ monthly_recurring_revenue() }} as mrr
FROM subscriptions
GROUP BY date_month

-- Automatically available in Omni as pre-calculated field
-- No risk of inconsistent business logic across tools
```

#### Automated Documentation Sync
```yaml
# dbt documentation flows to Omni
dbt_docs:
  model: "customer_metrics"
  description: |
    Core customer metrics calculated daily.
    Includes revenue, order patterns, and engagement scores.
    Updated via scheduled dbt run at 6 AM UTC.
    
  columns:
    customer_ltv:
      description: "Predicted customer lifetime value using ML model"
      business_logic: "sum(historical_revenue) + predicted_future_value"
      
omni_integration:
  topic: "Customer Analytics"
  auto_generated_context: |
    Core customer metrics calculated daily.
    Includes revenue, order patterns, and engagement scores.
    Updated via scheduled dbt run at 6 AM UTC.
    
  field_descriptions:
    customer_ltv: "Predicted customer lifetime value using ML model"
```

### Environment Promotion Strategy

#### Development → Staging → Production
```yaml
# Coordinated environment promotion
development_environment:
  dbt_target: "dev"
  omni_connection: "dev_warehouse"
  testing: "Individual developer testing"
  
staging_environment:
  dbt_target: "staging"
  omni_connection: "staging_warehouse"
  testing: "Integration testing and stakeholder review"
  
production_environment:
  dbt_target: "prod"
  omni_connection: "prod_warehouse"
  testing: "Live business reporting"

promotion_process:
  1. "Developer completes feature branch"
  2. "Automated testing in development"
  3. "Deploy to staging for stakeholder review"
  4. "Business approval and final testing"
  5. "Coordinated production deployment"
  6. "Monitor performance and rollback if needed"
```

#### Automated Testing Pipeline
```yaml
# CI/CD pipeline for analytics
testing_pipeline:
  dbt_tests:
    - "Schema tests (unique, not_null, relationships)"
    - "Data tests (accepted_values, custom business rules)"
    - "Performance tests (query execution time)"
    
  omni_tests:
    - "Model validation (all fields accessible)"
    - "Dashboard compatibility (existing dashboards still work)"
    - "Performance impact (query time regression)"
    - "Security validation (row-level security intact)"
    
  integration_tests:
    - "Data consistency between dbt output and Omni results"
    - "Business logic validation across tools"
    - "End-to-end workflow testing"
```
