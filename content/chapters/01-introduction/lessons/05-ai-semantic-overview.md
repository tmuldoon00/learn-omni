# AI-Powered Analytics with Semantic Models

This comprehensive 21-minute deep-dive reveals why Omni's approach to AI-powered analytics represents a breakthrough in business intelligence. Unlike tools that bolt AI onto existing architectures, Omni was designed from the ground up with AI and semantic modeling working in harmony.

## Why This AI Approach Matters

### **The AI Accuracy Problem**
Most BI tools with AI suffer from:
- **Hallucinations** - AI makes up metrics and relationships that don't exist
- **Context gaps** - AI doesn't understand your business definitions  
- **Inconsistent results** - Same question yields different answers
- **Security risks** - AI accesses data it shouldn't see

### **Omni's Semantic Foundation Solution**
Omni solves these issues by:
- **Grounding AI in business logic** - All responses based on your defined models
- **Maintaining context** - AI understands your metrics, dimensions, and relationships
- **Ensuring consistency** - Same underlying model drives all interfaces
- **Preserving security** - AI inherits your existing access controls
