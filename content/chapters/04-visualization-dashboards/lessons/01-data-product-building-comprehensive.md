Watch Christopher Merrick and Jack Sweeney build a real data product live, demonstrating how Omni transforms analytical insights into customer-facing applications that drive business value.

## The Data Product Revolution

### **What is a Data Product?**
Data products are applications that turn data into actionable intelligence for customers:
- **Customer-facing analytics** - Embedded dashboards and reports within applications
- **Self-service insights** - Customers can explore their own data without support
- **Competitive differentiation** - Data becomes a product feature that drives value
- **Revenue generation** - Analytics capabilities become billable product features

### **Traditional Challenges**
Building data products typically requires extensive development:
- **Complex infrastructure** - Database connections, authentication, security
- **Frontend development** - Custom visualization and dashboard creation
- **Backend APIs** - Data access layers and business logic
- **Months of development** - Traditional approaches require significant time investment

### **Omni's Revolutionary Approach**
