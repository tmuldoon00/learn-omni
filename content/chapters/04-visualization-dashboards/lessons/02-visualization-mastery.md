## Advanced Customization Techniques

### **Brand-Aligned Visualization Design**
Professional styling that matches organizational identity:

#### **Corporate Design System Integration**
```css
/* Advanced visualization styling */
.omni-chart-container {
  font-family: var(--corporate-font-primary);
  color-scheme: var(--corporate-color-palette);
}

.chart-title {
  font-size: 18px;
  font-weight: 600;
  color: var(--corporate-primary-color);
  margin-bottom: 16px;
}

.axis-labels {
  font-size: 12px;
  color: var(--corporate-text-secondary);
  font-weight: 400;
}

.legend {
  background: var(--corporate-background-subtle);
  border: 1px solid var(--corporate-border-color);
  border-radius: 4px;
  padding: 12px;
}

.series-colors {
  --series-1: var(--corporate-blue);
  --series-2: var(--corporate-green);
  --series-3: var(--corporate-orange);
  --series-4: var(--corporate-red);
}
```

#### **Dynamic Theming System**
```javascript
// Intelligent theme adaptation
class VisualizationTheme {
  constructor(brandConfig) {
    this.primaryColors = brandConfig.colorPalette;
    this.fonts = brandConfig.typography;
    this.spacing = brandConfig.layout;
  }
  
  generateChartTheme(chartType, seriesCount) {
    return {
      colors: this.generateColorSequence(seriesCount),
      typography: this.adaptFontsForChart(chartType),
      layout: this.calculateOptimalSpacing(chartType),
      accessibility: this.ensureContrastCompliance()
    };
  }
  
  generateColorSequence(count) {
    // Intelligent color selection ensuring visual distinction
    return this.primaryColors
      .slice(0, count)
      .map(color => this.adjustForAccessibility(color));
  }
}
```

## Performance Optimization for Complex Visualizations

### **Efficient Rendering Strategies**
Maintaining performance with sophisticated visualizations:

#### **Data Optimization Techniques**
```sql
-- Optimized data preparation for complex charts
WITH optimized_data AS (
  SELECT 
    time_bucket('1 hour', timestamp) as time_period,
    metric_category,
    AVG(metric_value) as avg_value,
    MIN(metric_value) as min_value,
    MAX(metric_value) as max_value,
    COUNT(*) as data_point_count
  FROM large_dataset
  WHERE timestamp >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '90 days'
  GROUP BY time_bucket('1 hour', timestamp), metric_category
),

statistical_overlays AS (
  SELECT 
    time_period,
    metric_category,
    avg_value,
    AVG(avg_value) OVER (
      PARTITION BY metric_category 
      ORDER BY time_period 
      ROWS BETWEEN 23 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
    ) as moving_average_24h
  FROM optimized_data
)

SELECT * FROM statistical_overlays
ORDER BY metric_category, time_period
```

#### **Progressive Enhancement Architecture**
```javascript
// Intelligent chart loading and enhancement
class AdvancedChart {
  constructor(container, data, config) {
    this.container = container;
    this.data = data;
    this.config = config;
    this.renderingStrategy = this.determineOptimalStrategy();
  }
  
  render() {
    // Progressive enhancement approach
    this.renderBasicChart()
      .then(() => this.addAdvancedFeatures())
      .then(() => this.enableInteractions())
      .then(() => this.optimizePerformance());
  }
  
  renderBasicChart() {
    // Fast initial render with core data
    return this.drawBasicSeries(this.data.core);
  }
  
  addAdvancedFeatures() {
    // Enhance with trendlines, annotations, etc.
    if (this.config.trendlines.enabled) {
      this.addTrendlines();
    }
    
    if (this.config.annotations.enabled) {
      this.addAnnotations();
    }
  }
}
```
