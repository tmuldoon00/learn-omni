# AI-Powered Text-to-Visualization

While Omni provides comprehensive built-in chart types, some analyses require truly custom visualizations. Text-to-visualization powered by GPT technology enables you to create sophisticated Vega-Lite visualizations using natural language descriptions, opening up unlimited custom visualization possibilities.

## Beyond Standard Chart Types

### The Long Tail of Visualization Needs
Standard BI tools cover 80% of visualization requirements with:
- Bar charts, line charts, pie charts
- Basic scatter plots and heatmaps
- Simple tables and KPI cards

The remaining 20% of use cases require specialized visualizations:
- **Complex Statistical Charts** - Box plots, violin plots, regression curves
- **Multi-Dimensional Analysis** - Parallel coordinates, radar charts, treemaps
- **Interactive Exploration** - Linked brushing, detail-on-demand, faceted views
- **Domain-Specific Visuals** - Network diagrams, geographic projections, specialized scientific charts

### Text-to-Vis Advantages
AI-powered visualization creation provides:
- **No Coding Required** - Describe complex visuals in plain English
- **Vega-Lite Power** - Access to the full Vega-Lite specification
- **Rapid Prototyping** - Iterate on visualization design through conversation
- **Best Practice Integration** - AI applies visualization design principles automatically

## How Text-to-Visualization Works

### Natural Language to Vega-Lite
The AI interprets visualization requests and generates Vega-Lite JSON specifications:

**Complex Statistical Analysis:**
> "Create a box plot showing sales distribution by region with outliers highlighted"

**Interactive Exploration:**
> "Build a scatter plot matrix showing correlations between revenue, profit margin, customer count, and deal size"

**Multi-Dimensional Views:**
> "Design a parallel coordinates chart showing customer segments across demographics, behavior, and value metrics"

### Advanced Visualization Examples

**Network Analysis:**
> "Show relationships between products as a network diagram where line thickness represents cross-sell frequency"

**Geographic Intelligence:**
> "Create a choropleth map of customer density with bubble overlays showing revenue by city"

**Time Series with Annotations:**
> "Build a line chart showing monthly revenue with vertical annotation lines for major product launches and marketing campaigns"

## Specialized Use Cases

### Financial Analytics

**Risk Assessment Visualization:**
```
Request: "Create a heat map showing portfolio risk across asset classes and time periods, with color intensity representing volatility"

Generated Output:
- 2D heat map with asset classes on Y-axis
- Time periods on X-axis
- Color scale from green (low risk) to red (high risk)
- Interactive tooltips showing specific volatility metrics
- Legend with risk threshold indicators
```

**Performance Attribution:**
```
Request: "Design a waterfall chart showing how different factors contributed to quarterly performance variance"

Generated Output:
- Starting performance baseline
- Positive/negative contribution bars for each factor
- Cumulative effect visualization
- Final performance endpoint
- Color coding for positive/negative impacts
```

### Marketing Campaign Analysis

**Customer Journey Visualization:**
```
Request: "Show customer journey paths as a Sankey diagram from awareness through conversion"

Generated Output:
- Flow diagram showing stage transitions
- Path thickness proportional to customer volume
- Different colors for conversion vs. drop-off paths
- Interactive hover details for each stage
- Conversion rate annotations
```

**Attribution Modeling:**
```
Request: "Create a stacked area chart showing marketing attribution across touchpoints over time"

Generated Output:
- Time series showing total conversions
- Stacked areas for each marketing channel
- Smooth interpolation between time periods
- Interactive legend for channel selection
- Percentage and absolute value modes
```

### Operational Analytics

**Supply Chain Visualization:**
```
Request: "Build a chord diagram showing material flows between suppliers, factories, and distribution centers"

Generated Output:
- Circular layout with entities around the perimeter
- Curved connections showing flow volumes
- Color coding by material type or urgency
- Interactive highlighting of connected entities
- Flow direction indicators
```

**Quality Control Analysis:**
```
Request: "Design a control chart showing process variation with statistical control limits and trend indicators"

Generated Output:
- Time series line chart with data points
- Upper and lower control limit lines
- Warning zones in different colors
- Trend arrows and statistical annotations
- Out-of-control point highlighting
```

## Technical Architecture

### Vega-Lite Integration
Text-to-vis leverages the full power of Vega-Lite:
- **Grammar of Graphics** - Systematic approach to visualization construction
- **Declarative Syntax** - Specifications describe what to show, not how to draw
- **Interactive Capabilities** - Built-in support for selection, filtering, and linked views
- **Statistical Transformations** - Automatic aggregation, binning, and statistical calculations

### AI-Generated Specifications
The system produces complete Vega-Lite JSON:
```json
{
  "$schema": "https://vega.github.io/schema/vega-lite/v5.json",
  "description": "AI-generated box plot with customizations",
  "data": {"values": [/* Omni data automatically injected */]},
  "mark": {
    "type": "boxplot",
    "outliers": {"color": "red", "size": 40}
  },
  "encoding": {
    "x": {"field": "region", "type": "nominal"},
    "y": {"field": "sales", "type": "quantitative"},
    "color": {"field": "region", "type": "nominal"}
  }
}
```

## Advanced Features

### Interactive Elements
AI can add sophisticated interactions:
- **Brushing and Linking** - Select data in one view to filter others
- **Detail on Demand** - Click for additional information panels
- **Dynamic Filtering** - UI controls that modify visualization parameters
- **Animation and Transitions** - Smooth changes between different data states

### Statistical Integration
Automatic inclusion of statistical elements:
- **Regression Lines** - Trend lines with confidence intervals
- **Statistical Annotations** - P-values, correlation coefficients, significance indicators
- **Distribution Overlays** - Normal curves, kernel density estimates
- **Outlier Detection** - Automatic identification and highlighting of anomalous points

### Performance Optimization
AI considers performance implications:
- **Data Sampling** - Intelligent sampling for large datasets
- **Aggregation Strategies** - Pre-aggregation for complex calculations
- **Rendering Efficiency** - Optimization for smooth interaction and display
- **Progressive Loading** - Prioritize key visual elements for fast initial render

## Best Practices

### Effective Visualization Requests

**Be Specific About Purpose:**
✅ "Create a visualization to help executives identify which product categories are cannibalizing each other's sales"
❌ "Make a chart showing product data"

**Include Context and Constraints:**
✅ "Design a mobile-friendly dashboard tile showing customer satisfaction trends with clear color coding for threshold breaches"
❌ "Show customer satisfaction over time"

**Specify Interaction Requirements:**
✅ "Build an interactive scatter plot where clicking a point shows detail panel with customer information and selecting a region filters related charts"
❌ "Make an interactive scatter plot"

### Iterative Refinement
- **Start Simple** - Begin with basic visualization concept
