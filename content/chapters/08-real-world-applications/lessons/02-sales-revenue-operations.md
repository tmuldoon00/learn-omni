# Sales and Revenue Operations

Sales teams need accurate forecasting, pipeline visibility, and performance insights to hit their targets. This case study demonstrates how a growing SaaS company transformed their sales operations with Omni Analytics, featuring insights from Krzysztof Ławecki at Ramp Network on reinventing their data experience.

## The Challenge: Sales Visibility Gap

### Before Omni: Revenue Recognition Crisis
**Mike, VP of Sales at GrowthTech:**
> "We were managing a $50M pipeline across 3 regions and 25 reps, but our forecasting was off by 30% every quarter. We had data in Salesforce, HubSpot, Stripe, and spreadsheets, but no single view of what was really happening."

**Critical Pain Points:**
- **Inaccurate Forecasting** - Revenue predictions missed by 25-35%
- **Pipeline Opacity** - No visibility into deal health and velocity
- **Rep Performance Blindness** - Couldn't identify top performers vs. strugglers
- **Commission Disputes** - Manual calculations led to frequent errors
- **Reporting Overhead** - 15+ hours weekly for basic sales reports
- **Strategic Planning Gaps** - No data-driven territory or quota planning

### The Business Stakes
- **Company Size:** $50M ARR, 180 employees
- **Growth Target:** 40% year-over-year revenue growth
- **Pipeline Value:** $50M across 500+ active opportunities
- **Sales Team:** 25 reps across 3 regions
- **Forecast Accuracy:** Critical for investor relations and planning

## The Solution: Unified Sales Operations Platform

### Data Architecture Strategy

#### Integrated Data Sources
```
🔗 Salesforce CRM → Pipeline, opportunities, activities
🔗 HubSpot Marketing → Leads, campaign attribution
🔗 Stripe Billing → Revenue, subscriptions, churn
🔗 Outreach.io → Sales activities, email tracking
🔗 Calendly → Meeting bookings and conversion
🔗 ZoomInfo → Prospect intelligence
🔗 ChartMogul → Subscription metrics, MRR/ARR
```

#### Core Data Model
**Primary Tables:**
- `opportunities` - Deal pipeline and stage progression
- `accounts` - Customer and prospect information
- `contacts` - Individual decision makers and influencers
- `activities` - Sales touches, meetings, emails, calls
- `subscriptions` - Revenue contracts and renewals
- `sales_reps` - Performance metrics and territory assignments

**Key Relationships:**
```
sales_reps → territories → accounts → opportunities → revenue
                    ↓
                activities → contacts
```

### Analytics Implementation

#### 1. Revenue Forecasting Dashboard

**Predictive Metrics:**
- **Weighted Pipeline Value** - Probability-adjusted revenue
- **Velocity Metrics** - Average days in each stage
- **Win Rate Analysis** - Historical and trending conversion rates
- **Seasonality Patterns** - Monthly/quarterly revenue cycles
- **Rep Capacity Planning** - Quota vs. pipeline coverage

**Forecasting Models:**
```sql
-- Weighted Pipeline Forecast
SELECT 
  close_month,
  sales_rep,
  SUM(opportunity_value * win_probability) as weighted_pipeline,
  SUM(CASE WHEN stage = 'Closed Won' THEN opportunity_value END) as closed_won,
  SUM(opportunity_value) as total_pipeline
FROM opportunities 
WHERE close_date >= CURRENT_DATE
GROUP BY close_month, sales_rep
ORDER BY close_month
```
