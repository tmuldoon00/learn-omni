# Customer Success: Front and Snowflake Partnership

This compelling 24-minute conversation brings together three data industry leaders to share real-world insights on modern business intelligence transformation. Listen as Omni co-founder Jamie Davidson speaks with Josh Klahr from Snowflake and Théo Gantzer from Front about their actual migration experience, industry trends, and the practical realities of implementing next-generation analytics platforms in enterprise environments.

## The Customer Migration Reality

### **Traditional BI Migration Challenges**
Enterprise organizations face significant obstacles when evolving their analytics platforms:
- **Legacy system entrenchment** - Existing investments in traditional BI tools create inertia
- **User adoption barriers** - Teams resist learning new interfaces and changing established workflows
- **Migration complexity** - Moving existing content, models, and processes to new platforms
- **Performance expectations** - Need to maintain or improve performance during transition
- **ROI justification** - Demonstrating clear business value for platform migration investments

### **Modern BI Requirements Driving Change**
Organizations recognize limitations of traditional approaches:
- **Self-service accessibility** - Business users need direct access to data without technical barriers
- **Development agility** - Faster iteration cycles for analytics development and deployment
- **Unified workflow integration** - Seamless connection between technical and business analytics work
- **Scalable governance** - Enterprise controls that don't inhibit innovation and exploration
- **Competitive differentiation** - Analytics capabilities that drive business advantage

### **Real Customer Success Patterns**
Understanding actual transformation experiences:
- **Migration strategy** - Practical approaches to moving from legacy BI to modern platforms
- **User adoption** - How organizations successfully onboard teams to new analytics paradigms
- **Technical integration** - Real-world implementation of modern data stack components
- **Business impact** - Measured improvements in decision speed, data quality, and user satisfaction
