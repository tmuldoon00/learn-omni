# Marketing Analytics Use Case

Marketing teams need to prove ROI, optimize campaigns, and understand customer acquisition. This case study shows how a typical marketing team uses Omni Analytics to transform their data into actionable insights, featuring insights from Edward Mancey at Synthesia on implementing radical self-service analytics.

## The Challenge: Marketing Attribution Chaos

### Before Omni: Common Pain Points
**Sarah, Marketing Director at TechCorp:**
> "We had data everywhere - Google Ads, Facebook, email platforms, our CRM, website analytics. Each tool had its own metrics, and we couldn't get a unified view of which campaigns actually drove revenue."

**Specific Problems:**
- **Siloed Data** - 8 different tools, no single source of truth
- **Attribution Confusion** - Unclear which touchpoints drove conversions
- **Manual Reporting** - 20+ hours per week creating executive reports
- **Campaign Optimization Lag** - Decisions made on week-old data
- **Budget Allocation Guesswork** - No clear ROI visibility by channel

### The Business Impact
- Marketing spend: $500K/month across channels
- Revenue attribution: Estimated 60% inaccuracy
- Reporting overhead: 80+ hours per month
- Decision speed: 1-2 week lag on optimization

## The Solution: Unified Marketing Analytics

### Data Integration Strategy

#### Connected Data Sources
```
üîó Google Ads ‚Üí Campaign performance, cost data
üîó Facebook Ads ‚Üí Social media campaign metrics

üîó Stripe ‚Üí Revenue and transaction data
üîó Google Analytics ‚Üí Website behavior data

### Analytics Implementation

#### 1. Campaign Performance Dashboard

**Key Metrics Tracked:**
- **Cost per Lead (CPL)** by channel and campaign
- **Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)** with full attribution
- **Return on Ad Spend (ROAS)** across all channels
- **Lead Quality Score** based on conversion likelihood
- **Campaign Velocity** - time from impression to conversion

**Sample Queries Built:**
```sql
-- Top Performing Campaigns by ROAS
SELECT 
  campaign_name,
  channel,
  total_spend,
  attributed_revenue,
  (attributed_revenue / total_spend) as roas
FROM campaign_performance
WHERE date_range = 'last_30_days'
ORDER BY roas DESC
LIMIT 10
```

#### 2. Attribution Modeling

**Multi-Touch Attribution Setup:**
- **First Touch** - Initial discovery attribution
