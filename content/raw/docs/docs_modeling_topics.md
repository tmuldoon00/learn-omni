In Omni, a

Topic

is a curated dataset that organizes and structures data around a specific area of interest or analysis.

Topics can help you improve:

Self-service

. Creating refined subsets of data means users can query and explore without needing to understand the entire data model.

Reusability

. Once defined, topics can be re-used in any analysis that utilizes the model containing the topic.

Consistency.

Topics ensure that analyses across different users or teams are built using the same data definitions and logic.

What's a topic?

Topics are defined within

models

and linked to a

specific database connection

. They specify a primary base table along with any associated tables that can be joined for analysis.

Creating topics

Topics can be created in a few ways:

In the workbook

There are two ways to create a topic in the workbook:

In the

Fields & topics

panel, right click on a view and select

Modeling > Make topic

Create a blank table

and:

If you're a

Restricted Querier

, a topic will be automatically created

If you're a

Querier

Connection Admin

, check the

Create topic

box in the upload dialog

Note

: Topics created using either of these methods must be promoted to the shared model to be accessible outside the workbook.

In the IDE

In the

Files

panel of the modeling IDE, click the

button in the

Topics

section.

You'll be prompted to enter a name for the topic. Currently, Omni will use this name to automatically set the topic's base view. If the name doesn't match an existing view, the IDE will display an error.

To resolve this, enter the desired name for the topic and use the

base_view

parameter to define the  base view:

base_view

main__sales

Defining topic settings

Every topic has an associated topic file, where you can define various settings to apply to the topic. For example, data access control, cache policies, default filters, and so on. Refer to the

Topic file parameters reference

for more information about these settings.

Using topics in analyses

To use a topic in an analysis, use the topic switcher in the workbook's

Fields & topics

panel. A list of tables included in the topic will populate the panel, which you can then use in your analysis.

Adding tables to topics using joins

note

Topics created from

data input tables or uploaded CSV/XLSX files

can't be used in joins unless the table has been pushed to a database.

By default, when you create a topic, Omni adds all joinable non-fanout tables to the topic â€” specifically those with

many-to-one

one-to-one

relationships to other tables. The list of joinable tables can also be curated, either to remove joins generated by default or to force in tables that would fan out the base table, such as

many-to-many

one-to-many

joins.

Joins added to the model's

relationships file

can also be added to topics.

Adding joins can be done a few ways:

In the workbook

In the

Fields & topics

panel of a workbook, right click on a topic and open the

Joins

menu.

If joins have been inferred, they'll be listed in this menu above

New join

. Select an option or

New join

In the

Join

dialog, you can:

Add an inferred join by clicking

Add

, if available

Manually add a new join by selecting a table, join key, type, and optionally, a relationship. You can also click

Infer Relationship

. This will examine the cardinality between each join key and select the proper relationship.

We recommend having Omni infer the relationship, as often uniqueness may not match expectation and this can flag potential data issues like duplicated rows or keys.

To make joins available to the shared model, remember to

promote them

In the IDE

To add tables to a topic in the IDE, use the

joins

parameter in the topic's file. Refer to the

Topic file parameter reference

for more information.

warning

When joins are deleted or modified to become invalid, they must be manually removed from a topic.
