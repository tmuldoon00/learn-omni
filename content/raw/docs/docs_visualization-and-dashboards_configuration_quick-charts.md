The quick chart icons offer shortcuts to pre-configured chart types.  They offer a faster way to configure between layouts like stacking vs grouped bars, mixed bar-line charts, or toggle between table / chart / markdown / advanced visualization without digging into the lower level menus.

At times choosing between different quick charts will not impact the visualization (for example stacking / unstacking with only one dimension), so the query may need to be altered to enable the depth of each chart type.  Omni will also take a best guess at the right quick chart for each new query, while attempting to retain ad hoc changes made across the specific configurations.

To clear out all the visualization and have Omni re-guess the best quick chart,

Tab > Reset Chart

in the top bar will reset the visualization controls.
