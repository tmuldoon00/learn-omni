tip

These control only the

axis itself

to customize the

series mapped to the axis

use the dropdown next to the series/field.

Reference lines

Reference lines offer a quick way to set targets on a chart.  There is limited configuration for these, so more complex use cases may be better served with table calculations as a regular, independent series.

Notes

When tuning axis colors note that there is not independent configuration for light and dark mode.  The default palette will adjust colors (ie. dark axis in light mode; light axis in dark mode), but when they are hard-coded they will be respected in light and dark mode.

The configuration can be reset (note, entirely for the viz to defaults) under Tab > Reset Chart

Long-tail axis configuration is available in the

Vega-lite spec
