As your team creates content, finding the right balance between access and findability becomes crucial. Omni's content system allows you to efficiently manage your content with:

Folders

, which provide a simple, hierarchical structure for organizing content and controlling access

Labels

, which can enhance findability without the need for duplicating content across folders

By combining folders and labels, you can create an intuitive content organization system that supports your team’s collaboration by ensuring that the right content is always easy to find.

Folders

Using folders for content organization allows you to maintain structure and determine how users access content. For example, folders could allow you to organize content and access for:

Teams, such as

Operations

Finance

Employee level, such as

Manager

Executive

Projects

Clients

Folders can contain documents and subfolders.

Creating folders

To create a folder, click

Add folder

in the

My documents

folder or your organization's

Shared

hub.

Note

: Your

organization's

Content organization

setting

determines if users can create content in the root of the shared space.

Creating subfolders in folders is supported. The parent folder can contain up to seven levels of nesting, for example:

. Shared (root)

└── Folder 1

## Parent folder

└── Folder 2

└── Folder 3

└── Folder 4

└── Folder 5

└── Folder 6

└── Folder 7

## Nesting limit

Moving folders

To move a folder:

Open the folder and click the

Options menu (three dots)

next to the

Share

icon, or

On a page like the shared

Hub

My Documents

, click the

Options (three dots) menu

next to the folder:

Click

Move

Select the folder to move to.

Click

Save

Accessing & sharing folders

The contents of a folder - including any subfolders - will inherit the access role of the parent folder. Refer to the

Sharing content guide

for more information and examples.

Deleting folders

Folders can only be deleted if they're empty. To delete a folder, click the folder's

Options

menu (three dots) and then

Delete

Labels

While folders are helpful for maintaining structure and access, a document can only be in one folder at a time. For example, a dashboard is relevant to multiple teams, each of which has their own folder. Where should the document be located?

With labels, you could place the dashboard in a shared folder and add relevant labels, ensuring the right people can find the content. Labels allow you to organize your content in a way that doesn't require duplication or sacrifice findability.

Using labels, you can:

Organize content by subject area, such as

Marketing

Support

Indicate the current working state of a document, such as

In progress

Use

special Omni-provided tags

to:

Curate

page content for your organization

Mark important content as

Verified

Applying labels

To apply a label to a document or a folder, click the

Labels

icon to the right of the document/folder name:

Note

: You must be in the published version of a document to apply labels.

Managing labels

Labels are managed in the

Label settings

page, which can be accessed by:

Navigating to

Settings > Labels

, or

Clicking the

Labels

icon in a document or folder, then the

gear icon

On the

Label settings

page, you can:

Add a label

by clicking the

Add Label

button.

Rename a label

by clicking the

options menu

(three dots) next to the label and selecting

Rename

Delete a label

by clicking the

options menu

(three dots) next to the label and selecting

Delete

Note

: Labels can't be deleted if they're currently in use.

You can also apply

special tags

to labels, which will give them additional functionality.

Curating content with special tags

note

Instance Admin permissions are required to:

Apply special tags to an existing label

Apply labels with special tags to a document or folder

Omni includes two special, protected tags that can be applied to existing labels:

The

Homepage

tag allows you to select content to display on your users'

page, in the

For you

section. This can be useful for:

Providing helpful starting points for new users in your organization

Ensuring content relevant to all users is easily accessible

The

Verified

tag allows you to mark important content, such as dashboards that are monitored for correctness. This can be helpful for conveying to your users which content is actively maintained or has been vetted.

To apply these tags to a label, click the

options menu

(three dots) next to a label and select one or both of the tags:

When the tags are applied, the corresponding label will be highlighted to increase prominence. Labels with the

Verified

tag will be highlighted green with a checkmark, while those with the

Homepage

tag will have a

Home Page

badge:
