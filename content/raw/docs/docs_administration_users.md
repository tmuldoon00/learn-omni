Managing users effectively is essential to maintaining security, collaboration, and productivity within your Omni organization. This guide covers how to add and remove users, assign roles and permissions, and ensure that the right team members have access to the right resources.

By the end of this guide, you'll understand how to manage your organization's users, tailor permissions to fit different needs, and keep your workspace organized and secure.

Inviting users

info

Organization Admin

permissions are required to

invite users

If the

New user invitations

setting is enabled, users can request an invitation from your organization's login page.

Otherwise, you can manually invite new users:

Navigate to

Settings > Users

Click

Invite

In the

Email

field, add the emails of the users you want to invite as a comma-separated list. For example:

blobby@blobsrus.com,blob.ross@blobsrus.com

Click

Send invitations

After the invitation is sent, the user will appear in the

Users

list with an

Invited

badge and you'll be able to

assign permissions

to the user:

Re-inviting users

info

Organization Admin

permissions are required to

invite users

If a user hasnâ€™t accepted their invitation or needs a new one, you can revoke and re-send their invite:

Navigate to

Settings > Users

In the

Users

list, find the user with the

Invited

badge.

Click

Manage

next to their name.

At the bottom of the user's profile page, click

Revoke invitation

Return to

Settings > Users

and click

Invite

In the

Email

field, add the user's email address.

Click

Send invitations

The user will receive a new invite email and appear in the

Users

list with a refreshed

Invited

badge.

Managing user settings

Navigate to

Settings > Users

In the user list, hover over the user you want to modify.

Click the

Manage

button that appears.

On the user's profile page, you'll be able to

assign permissions to the user

and set the user's

query timezone

User permissions

info

Organization Admin

permissions are required to

modify a user's permissions

At the user level, permissions are assigned using the

Organization role

and

Connection access

sections of the user's profile page:

Organization role

controls the user's permissions to manage the organization. This includes the ability to invite and manage other users, manage database connections, and modify

organization settings

Note

Organization Admins

can't be provisioned using SCIM.

Connection access

controls the access the user has to

database connections

and the ability to create/access content built on the connection, run queries, and develop models. Refer to the

Managing connection permissions guide

for more information.

Not sure what permissions to set?

Check out the

Common permissions scenarios guide

to learn what permissions to set in specific scenarios, such as restricting access to datasets based on team.

Query timezone

The

Query timezone

setting defines the timezone used for query conversion, if user-specific timezones are enabled for a connection. Refer to the

Timezone settings guide

for more information.

User attributes

User attributes, managed in the user's

Attributes

tab, allow you to map user-specific variables to operations in Omni, such as querying, dashboards, and controlling data access. Refer to the

User attributes guide

for more information and examples.

Impersonating users

info

Organization Admin

permissions are required to

impersonate other users. Additionally, admins can't impersonate other admins

The

Impersonate user

feature is useful for testing that access grants work as expected:

Navigate to

Settings > Users

and click on a user.

Note

: If testing an

access grant

, the user must have a

user attribute value

that excludes them from the grant.

At the bottom of the user's details page, click

Impersonate user

Create a new workbook based on the connection you want to test. In this environment, you can verify what the user would and wouldn't have access to and adjust their permissions accordingly.

Resetting introductions

If a user needs a refresher on Omni's latest features, you can use the

Reset introductions

button. This will reactivate any previously dismissed feature introductions - specifically, the tooltips that highlight updates - that display in the app:

Deleting users

Proceed with caution

Revoking a user is

not reversible

. Read this section carefully before revoking a user's membership.

When a user's membership to your Omni instance is revoked, the following will occur:

Schedules created by the user will no longer run

. The schedules must be re-created by another user to continue.

Content in the user's

Personal folder

will be accessible to

Organization Admins

through search.

Even if the user is re-added to your Omni instance with the same name and email, their previous history, permissions, content, etc. will not be associated with them. It will be as if they are a brand new user.

Before deletion

Before removing a user, you should:

Move any content in the user's Personal folder to a different location

. Prior to being revoked,

Organization Admins

can impersonate the user to directly access this folder and move its content. You can also use the

Analytics

dashboard to identify the content the user owns, including that in their personal folder.

Re-create any necessary schedules created by the user

. Schedules created by the user can be identified using the

Settings > Deliveries

page.

After deletion

Organization Admins

can still find and access the user's

Personal

content using search or the

Analytics

dashboard after the user is removed. The

Settings > Deliveries

page will also list the user's schedules.
