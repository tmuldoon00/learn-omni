By default, outgoing database connections from Omni originate from a set list of IP addresses per environment.

Omni's IP addresses can be found on an individual connection's page, accessed by navigating to

Settings > Connections

and clicking a connection.

Note

: If you choose to limit access to your database by IP address, make sure all the IPs listed on this page are included in the allowlist.
