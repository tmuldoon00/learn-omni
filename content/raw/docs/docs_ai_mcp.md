To have this feature enabled, reach out to Omni support.

The Omni MCP Server lets you connect external AI tools directly to an Omni model, unlocking new ways to explore and analyze your data. It enables natural language querying across your datasets, similar to how you’d interact with Omni, while taking advantage of the enhanced context, reasoning, or memory capabilities of external AI tools.

For example, you could include the results of a web search as additional context to the MCP before running an Omni query.

Features

Natural language querying

– Ask questions using natural language and let Omni translate it into a query

Iterative, multi-step analysis

– Chain queries together, retain results in memory, and perform deeper analysis across steps

Flexible integration

- Connect to a variety of

compatible AI clients

to expand beyond Omni's native chat experience

Scoped, secure data access

– Interactions are scoped only to the model (and topic, if provided) provided to the MCP, preventing unauthorized data access when querying
