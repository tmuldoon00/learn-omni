Workbook queries can be saved as views, allowing you to quickly build and join subqueries to your analysis. This workflow allows you to do light transformations on data, which are then compiled as CTEs when queried.

Creating query views

Start by building out a query in a workbook. Then:

Click

Model > Save query as view

When prompted, enter a name for the view. For example,

user_facts

Click

Create query view

A new tab will open where you can edit the view itself. You can add or remove fields, add calculated fields, and add joins, just like you would with any other database view:

Click the

Save changes to view

button to apply the changes to the view. This tab can be closed and you'll still be able to use the view in other workbook queries.

Working with query views

After the view is saved, it will appear in the field browser and be queryable just like any other database view.

Editing query views

Query views can be edited in the workbook or the modeling IDE:

In the workbook

In a query, hover over the view in the field browser.

Click the â ‡

(three dots)

next to the view name, then select

Modeling > Edit

A new tab will open in the workbook where you can edit the query view.

When finished making changes, click

Save changes to view

In the IDE

In the

Files

panel of the modeling IDE, locate the view in the

Schemas

section. Click the view to open it in the editor.

You can also view a read-only version of the query view's YAML configuration right in the workbook. Open the query view like you're going to edit it, then click the

YAML

Click the

Edit in IDE

link to open the query view in the modeling IDE. Refer to the

Query view parameter reference

for more information about the available parameters for query views.

Promoting query views

To promote the query view to the shared model, use the

Model changes

panel in the workbook
