Demo: Omni's MCP Server,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maxp_uZVib0,maxp_uZVib0,2025-07-16,07:46,466,33,2,"Today, we're excited to launch Omni's new MCP server.

Omni‚Äôs MCP server lets you plug into Omni wherever you‚Äôre already using LLMs (as long as they support MCPs). Anyone can ask a question about their data in their favorite AI interface, and the LLM will ‚Äúborrow‚Äù Omni‚Äôs capabilities to return a result governed by your business logic and security protocols.

Data teams can set up the MCP server behind the scenes, and everyone can simply ask questions and get answers.

Unlike traditional text-to-SQL approaches, Omni‚Äôs semantic model helps prevent hallucinations and protect against data leakage. With the MCP server, AI queries inherit both access controls and business context defined in your semantic model. That means users only see data they‚Äôre allowed to access, and AI responses stay grounded in logic your team has already built.

This video from Omni co-founder Jamie Davidson shows how you can build Omni reports and dashboards from semantic views, and write DDL back to Snowflake using our APIs. 

This lets users analyze Snowflake semantic views using intuitive tools in Omni, including Excel functions, natural language querying, SQL or point-and-click insights.
